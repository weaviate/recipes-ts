Add the cubed butter, distributing it all over the top of the dry ingredients, then dollop in the cream cheese (1-inch dollops should do it, but it doesn't need to be perfect). Turn the mixer on low speed and mix until the mixture is mostly mealy and there are still some larger clumps of butter and cream cheese intact. With the mixer still running, add the egg yolks, vanilla and almond extract, if using, then continue mixing until the dough comes together. Divide the dough in half and shape into 2 discs. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\nMelt the chocolate in a double boiler, stirring constantly, or in a microwaveable bowl in 30-second increments, stirring after each. Set aside to cool briefly while you roll out the dough.\nBeat the remaining whole egg with a splash of water for an egg wash. Roll out a dough disc on a lightly floured surface, dusting with flour as needed to prevent it from sticking, until it is a wide rectangle, 18-by-9-inches. Use an offset spatula to spread half of the chocolate over the dough in a thin even layer, leaving a 1-inch border along the long edge that's farthest from you. (Try to work kind of quickly so the chocolate doesn't harden.) Brush the border with a thin layer of egg wash. Starting on the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a long, tight log, then place it seam-side down on a cutting board or baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and chocolate. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days (depending on fridge space, you might want to cut the log in half so you're dealing with four shorter logs instead of two really long ones; wrap in plastic if refrigerating for longer than 1 hour).\nPreheat the oven to 375 degrees F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\nBrush the logs with a thin layer of egg wash, then sprinkle with a few pinches of flaky salt and a ton of sprinkles or sanding sugar. Cut into 1 1/2-inch slices and transfer to the baking sheets, spacing them 1 inch apart. Bake until golden brown on top, about 24 minutes. (You might notice that the cookies seem to sweat and leak out some fat while in the oven; this is completely normal.)

    "recipe": "Pithivier\n1/2 recipe Almond Cream, recipe follows\nPuff pastry, store bought\nEgg wash:\n2 large egg yolks\n1 large egg\n1/4 cup whole milk\n1/4 cup light corn syrup\n1 1/2 tablespoons water\nTo make almond flour:\n1 cup (125 grams) slivered almonds\n1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon room temperature unsalted butter\n1 large egg\nInstructions:\nPrepare the almond cream, place it in a pastry bag with a large opening (no tip) and set aside.\nPrepare the pithivier: Cut the puff pastry dough in 1/2 and roll each 1/2 into an 8 1/2-inch circle. Each circle will be about 1/8-inch thick. Place 1 of the circles on a parchment paper-covered baking sheet. Pipe a 5-inch-diameter mound of almond cream in the center of the circle. The mound should be about 1-inch high.\nPrepare the egg wash: Whisk together the egg yolks, whole egg, and milk in a small bowl until well combined. Lightly brush the remaining 1 1/2-inch rim of the pastry circle with the egg wash. Place the second circle of puff pastry over the first. Gently press against the sides of the almond cream mound to remove any trapped air. Seal the edges of the 2 layers by pressing the top edge into the bottom edge. This will keep the almond cream from running out as it bakes. Use a sharp knife to give the circle a fluted edge. It should look like a flower when finished. Use a sharp knife to pierce a 1/2-inch slit in the top layer at the center of the almond cream mound. This will allow steam to escape during baking.\nThis dessert usually has a classic pattern scored into its top. If you would like to try it, use a sharp knife to score a curved line that begins at the top of the mound and ends at the bottom of the mound. Repeat this line every 1/2-inch around the circumference of the mound, but be careful not to cut through the top layer and into the almond cream. Let the pithivier rest in the refrigerator for 1 hour before baking. (At this point, you can wrap the pithivier well in plastic wrap and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Let it thaw in the refrigerator or in your backpack before baking.)\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the pithiviers until it begins to brown slightly, about 20 minutes.\nMeanwhile, prepare the glaze: Stir together the corn syrup and water. Remove the pithivier from the oven and brush it well with the corn syrup mixture. This adds sweetness, enhances the color, and gives it a crispy crust. Lower the oven 20 degrees and continue to bake until well risen and evenly browned, about another 15 minutes. The baked pithivier should be flaky and tender, and the almond cream center still moist. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. The pithivier is best when served while it is still slightly warm. Use a serrated knife to slice it.\nI can't tell you how long the baked Pithivier can be stored because I never have any leftovers!\nIt is possible to buy almond flour (use 1 cup if you do) but it just as easy to make your own. Place the slivered almonds (no skin preferred) and granulated sugar into the food processor. Pulse until the almonds and sugar reach the consistency of flour. It is best to pulse because the heat of the blade will cause the release of the oil from the almonds.\nMix in the flour. Mix in the butter. Add the egg and mix until the mixture becomes light and creamy. Do not overmix or the gluten in the flour will overdevelop and the almond cream will lose its delicate texture when baked.\n",

If the dough doesn't hold together, add up to 2 more tablespoons ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and pulse again.\nTransfer the dough to a sheet of plastic wrap and pat into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours and up to overnight.  \nRoll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edges with your fingers. Freeze 20 minutes.    \nMeanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and coat a sheet of aluminum foil with nonstick spray.    \nPierce the bottom of the chilled dough all over with a fork. Line the dough with the foil, sprayed-side down, and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until the edges are set, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and continue baking until the crust is no longer glossy on the bottom, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely.  \nAdd the chocolate and coconut oil to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring in between each, until the mixture is melted and smooth, about 1 minute. Paint a thin layer of chocolate all over the bottom and sides of the crust. Let set at room temperature until the chocolate is hardened, about 15 minutes.  \nFor the filling: Put 1 1/2 cups water in a medium saucepan and sprinkle over the gelatin. Let sit until the gelatin is absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and heat over medium heat, whisking occasionally, just until the gelatin and sugar are dissolved, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and whisk in the peppermint extract.  \nPour the gelatin mixture into a large bowl and stir in 2 cups cold water. Use a spoon to scoop away any bubbles at the surface. Refrigerate, stirring every 10 minutes, until the gelatin just begins to thicken and is the consistency of thin fruit jelly, 30 to 45 minutes.    \nPour the gelatin mixture into the crust and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours and up to overnight.  \nFor the meringue: Bring a few inches of water to a boil in a saucepan that can hold a heatproof stand mixer's bowl above the water.  \nAdd the granulated sugar, lemon juice, salt and egg whites to the mixing bowl and whisk together by hand. Set the bowl above the boiling water and whisk until the mixture is warm to the touch and the sugar is completely dissolved (about 150 degrees F).    \nTransfer to the stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, add the peppermint extract and beat on medium-high speed until the mixture is cool and the whites hold stiff peaks, about 5 minutes.  \nTo assemble: Arrange the crushed peppermints around the edge of the pie. Cut into slices and top each with meringue, chocolate curls and more crushed peppermint.\n",

Add a 3-count of olive oil and gently brown the meatballs. Meanwhile, with a mortar and pestle, grind the salt, black peppercorns and fennel seeds with some olive oil into a grainy paste. Rub the ribs and shoulder with the mixture.\nRemove the meatballs with a slotted spoon and set aside on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. In the same pot, brown the shoulder pieces and ribs, in batches. Alternately to save time, roast the ribs in a preheated 500 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes while you brown the shoulder pieces in the pot.\nRemove the shoulder pieces and ribs to the meatball plate and let rest.\nAdd a little more olive oil to the pot and add the thyme, oregano, carrots, onion and celery. Stir it around and scrape up the bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Cook the vegetables until they are slightly softened and have some nice color. Add the wine, tomatoes and tomato paste and mix well, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom. Nestle the pork shoulder pieces back into the middle of the pot then arrange the ribs around the sauce. Finish by placing the meatballs in the gaps (some of the pieces will be sticking out from the sauce but that's perfectly fine as it will roast and caramelize). Use a spoon to baste everything well, cover, then put the pot into the oven and roast until the pork is tender and the meat is just falling off the rib bones, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nFor the topping: Combine the chopped raisins, toasted pine nuts and parsley in a small bowl.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove the meatballs and ribs to a large platter. Remove the pork shoulder pieces from the pot and allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing into bite-size pieces and adding them to the platter. Puree the sauce in a food processor then add it back to the pot and set over medium heat. Reduce the sauce until it is rich and thick, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. When the spaghetti is cooked, drain and add to a medium bowl. Spoon a little sauce over the spaghetti and the remaining sauce over the platter of meat. Garnish the meat platter with the raisin mixture and serve.\nHeat 3 tablespoons oil in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and parsley and cook until the vegetables are soft but not colored, about 10 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and let the mixture cool.\nAdd the bread to a medium bowl and pour in the milk. Let the bread soak while the onions are cooling. Combine the meats in a large bowl. Add the egg and cheese and season generously with salt and pepper. Use your hands to squeeze the excess milk out of the bread and add it to the bowl along with the cooled onion mixture. Gently combine all the ingredients with your hands until just mixed together. Don't overwork the mixture or the meatballs will be tough. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces and shape them into 8 nice looking meatballs. Refrigerate until ready to cook.\n",

    "recipe": "Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes\n1 cup soy oil\n1/2 cup onions, small dice\n3/4 cup peppers (red, green and yellow), small dice\n3 egg yolks\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice\n1/4 cup Dijon mustard\n1/2 tablespoon hot pepper sauce\n1 tablespoon Vietnamese fish sauce\n1 tablespoon freshly ground white pepper\n1 1/4 pounds jumbo lump crabmeat from Maine\n1 1/2 tablespoons each of dill, chives and parsley, cleaned, stems removed and roughly chopped\n1/4 loaf of fresh bread, crust removed, processed into crumbs\n1 cup Panko (Japanese) bread crumbs\nVegetable oil for sauteing\nInstructions:\nIn a saucepan over medium heat, place the oil, onions, and peppers, and simmer until tender, about 7 minutes. Combine the egg yolks, lime juice, mustard, hot pepper sauce, fish sauce, and white pepper in a large bowl. Remove the oil and vegetables from the heat. Slowly pour into the yolk mixture, whisking constantly. Begin by pouring with small splashes, incorporating the oil completely before adding more. The heat of the oil will cook the yolks as you go, and you should end up with a hollandaise-like sauce when all the oil has been blended. Return the bowl to the heat for 30 seconds, whisking constantly to insure that the sauce is fully incorporated. Set the sauce down over a bowl of ice and whisk to cool quickly. Refrigerate the sauce, covered, until well chilled.\nPick over crabmeat to remove any shell pieces. Add the herbs and gently toss, taking care not to break up the crab. Add two or three heaping tablespoons of the chilled sauce to the crab and gently combine. Add enough of the fresh breadcrumbs to bind the crab mixture. Check to see that the mixture is moist (the breadcrumbs will absorb moisture as the crab mixture sits) and add more sauce or breadcrumbs as needed and taste for seasoning. Spread Japanese breadcrumbs on a work surface and place ring mold on top. Pat the crab into the mold and top with more Japanese breadcrumbs. Tap down to secure crumbs. Remove crab cakes from the mold and set aside. Repeat until all crab is used.\nHeat some of the vegetable oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Sauteing in batches, brown the crab cakes on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Reserve on an ovenproof platter. Place platter in a pre-heated 350-degree oven until heated through, about 5 minutes, and serve.\n",

Line two 2 dozen mini-cupcake pans with paper cupcake liners and spray with oil spray.\nFor the crust: In a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, add the hazelnuts, brown sugar and gingersnaps, and pulse until a medium-fine paste. Then, add the butter and liqueur, and pulse until it's a paste that sticks when pinched with your fingers. Place 1 tablespoon of the crust into the prepared pans.\nFor the cupcakes: In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside. In the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and then beat in the extracts. With the mixer on low speed, add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk and beginning and ending with the flour mixture; beat until combined after each addition. Fold in the caramel pieces with a rubber spatula. Using a small ice cream scoop, scoop the batter into the prepared pans three-quarters of the way full. Bake until a toothpick comes out clean, about 11 minutes. Remove the cupcakes from the pans when cool to the touch.\nFor the butterscotch glaze: In a saucepan over low heat, combine the brown sugar, evaporated milk and butter, and cook for 10 minutes, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and allow to slightly cool (it will thicken as it cools). Reserve for assembly.\nFor the frosting: In the bowl of an upright mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt together until lightened and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and add the confectioners' sugar. Mix until thoroughly combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the caramel sauce, heavy cream and vanilla bean paste. Beat on medium-high speed until light and airy and completely mixed, about 2 minutes). Place in a pastry bag fitted with a small star tip and leave at room temperature.\nFor the stars: Lay out a large piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet on your work surface and spray with oil spray. In a medium saucepan, mix the granulated sugar, salt and 3/4 cup water; stir over low heat until the sugar dissolves to make a syrup. Increase the heat and bring the syrup to a boil. Lower the heat slightly and swirl the pan once or twice so the syrup colors evenly to a golden blonde. Remove from the heat and transfer to a flat work surface. Dip the tines of a fork into the golden blonde colored caramel and, in sweeping motions, make a star pattern on the parchment paper. Repeat until the desired amount of stars is achieved. Allow the caramel to harden, and then gently lift off the parchment paper and reserve for cupcake adornments.\nTo assemble: Dip the tops of the cooled cupcakes in the room temperature butterscotch glaze. Pipe the caramel buttercream frosting in a 1-inch diameter rosette on top of the glazed cupcakes, and sprinkle with edible star glitter and turbinado sugar. Then finish by adorning with a radiating star topper.\n",

Divide the chopped onion and carrot equally among the cavities of the pheasants. Squeeze the juice from both halves of the orange and set aside. Cut 1 of the squeezed halves into 3 pieces, and tuck inside of the cavities along with the veggies. Insert 1sprig of thyme into the cavity of each pheasant.\nArrange the pheasants in a large roasting pan, breast sides up. Lay 2 strips of bacon over the top of each pheasant, cutting the bacon into pieces if necessary to cover as much of the pheasant as possible. Roast for 15 minutes, then remove the bacon strips and continue roasting for approximately 30 to 40 minutes, or until the juices run clear. (It is important to not overcook the pheasants, as they are very lean birds.) Remove the pheasants from the oven and transfer to a serving platter, loosely tented, while you make the sauce.\nUsing a spoon, carefully remove as much extra fat from the pan as possible. Place the roasting pan over high heat and, when hot, deglaze with the reserved orange juice and Madeira, using a wooden spoon to scrape any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. When the orange juice and Madeira have reduced by half, add the chicken stock and continue to cook until sauce has reduced enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes. Swirl in the butter and remove from the heat. Season, to taste, with salt and pepper.\nRemove the back bone from each pheasant, then cut along the breast bone to divide the birds into two halves. Serve 1/2 pheasant per person, napped with some of the sauce and with some of the Wild Mushroom Bread Pudding.\nHeat the oil in a large, deep skillet over high heat. Add the onions and cook until golden brown and tender, 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of the garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of the Essence, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 3/4 teaspoon of the pepper, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are tender and have given off their liquid, about 5 minutes. Add the beer and cook, stirring, to deglaze the pan and until the mixture is almost dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool.\nIn a large bowl, combine the eggs, cream, molasses, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of Essence, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of pepper, and whisk well to combine. Add the mushroom mixture and cheeses and stir well. Add the bread cubes and let sit until the bread has absorbed the liquid, 2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\nButter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish with the butter. Add the bread crumbs, shaking to cover the bottom evenly. Pour the bread pudding mixture into the prepared pan and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 1 hour and uncover. Continue baking until risen and firm in the center, and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes.

Put on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels and sprinkle with salt. Allow the salt to extract some of the moisture from the eggplant slices for at least 10 minutes while you prep the rest of your ingredients.  \nTake three plates and fill one with the flour, one with the beaten eggs and the third with the breadcrumbs. Dry the eggplant slices with the paper towels. Then coat each slice in the flour, then the eggs and finishing with the breadcrumbs. Allow these slices to rest for a minute; this will make the coating stick a little better and dry out to make a crispier crunch.  \nCoat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat with enough vegetable oil for shallow frying. Fry the eggplant slices in batches until golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper as soon as soon as they come out. Allow to cool completely.  \nFor the tomato concasse: In a saute pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onions, oregano and chile flakes if using, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute. Add the tomatoes, lower the heat and simmer until the sauce is thick and chunky, about 10 minutes. Cool completely.  \nFor the empanadas: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Roll out each sheet of puff pastry dough to a 12-by-12-inch square and cut four 6-inch rounds out of each sheet. Place 1 slice eggplant in the middle of the dough round. Top with a tablespoon of tomato concasse, followed by a piece of the mozzarella cheese. Fold the dough over and seal using the back of a fork. Whisk the egg with a little water and brush the empanadas. Sprinkle a little dried oregano and the Parmesan on the tops. Bake until golden, about 15 minutes.  \nPuree the remaining tomato concasse; that'll be your dipping sauce for the empanadas.\n",

Deglaze the frying pan with white wine, cover with a lid and let cook until the mussels and clams start to open. Strain mussels and clams and set aside, reserving the liquid (it will be used to make the veloute).\nIn a frying pan, add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and heat the pan until it is smoking hot. Season the shrimp and scallops with salt and pepper. Carefully place the scallops in the pan and sear, until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the shrimp to the same pan and saute until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.\nIn the same frying pan, add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and let it get hot. Add the mushrooms and saute until they are cooked and most of their liquid is released. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the mushrooms from the pan and set aside.\nPreheat the broiler.\nTo make the veloute: In a saute pan melt butter and add flour until both mix evenly together. Let cook for a few minutes on light heat until the mixture resembles pancake batter. Take the pan you used to cook the shrimps and scallops and deglaze it with the liquid you saved from the mussels and clams and squeeze in the lemon. Add the fumet and let reduce. Add the cream and again let reduce over medium heat. Add the butter flour mixture and stir until everything starts to thicken. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.\nRemove the shells of the mussels and clams. Cut the scallops in 4 and remove any shell that is still on the shrimp. Add the mushrooms, scallops, shrimp, mussels, and clams to the veloute and stir everything with a spoon. Fill the baking shells or bowls with the seafood veloute and sprinkle the top with bread crumbs and parsley. Place under a broiler until the top becomes golden brown. Place the hot dish onto another plate to serve.\n",

Using a sharp knife, partially fillet both sides of the catfish as follows: cut straight into the fillet until the bone stops the knife, then turn the knife in and cut along the bone for about 2 inches, leaving a loose flap of fillet. Make as many of these incisions as it takes to cover both sides of the fish. Season fish and set aside.\nCombine dredging flour ingredients on a large plate and mix thoroughly. Set aside.\nCombine sauce ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk together to blend. Set aside.\nUsing a turning slicer, cut the carrot and beet into long strands. Rinse out the beet. Strain and add to carrot and drizzle with sesame oil. Peel, seed and cut tomatoes into large dice and set aside.\nSet fryer to 350 degrees. Dredge catfish in the flour. Shake off excess flour. Place catfish in a fryer basket, folding in the tail so that it curls away from the fish. Cook for about 12 minutes. To check doneness, lift one of the flaps cut in the fillet. If it comes clean off the bone, the fish is cooked. Allow fish to rest for a couple of minutes and transfer to a platter. Using a knife, cut through each flap and dislodge each from the carcass -- thereby finishing the filleting process. Ladle sauce over the entire fish. Sprinkle diced tomatoes and scallions. Put a dollop of pickled ginger on the nose and garnish with beet and carrot noodles as well as toasted sesame seeds. Serve immediately.\n",

(Or prepare a grill for high heat.)\nLine a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the tomatoes, onions, jalapeno and garlic on the parchment. Roast for 15 to 20 minutes, then remove the onions and garlic and set aside; peel the garlic. Return the baking sheet to the oven and roast the jalapeno and tomatoes until charred and soft, about 15 minutes more.\n(Or, if making on the grill, place the vegetables on a perforated pan or aluminum foil on the hot grill. Cook, covered and turning when necessary, until all the vegetables are evenly charred and soft. The tomatoes and jalapeno will take longer than the garlic and onions, so remove everything as it finishes cooking.)\nTransfer all the vegetables to a blender and add the cilantro, chipotles with adobo sauce and salt. Blend on medium speed until a uniform puree has formed. With the motor running, slowly add the oil until emulsified and completely incorporated. If the consistency of the salsa is too thick, add some water 1 tablespoon at a time until the desired consistency is achieved. Taste and adjust the seasonings, adding more chipotle if desired. Let cool before using, or transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until needed. The salsa will keep for up to 1 week.\nFor the skirt steak: Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper. Toss with some of the roasted tomato salsa and marinate, refrigerated, for at least 1 1/2 hours and up to overnight. Reserve the remaining salsa for serving.\nFor the grilled romaine: To clean the romaine, place the halves in a large bowl (or several bowls) filled with cold water. Swoosh the lettuce gently in the water and let it sit for 10 minutes--the dirt and grime will settle to the bottom of the bowl. Gently lift the lettuce out of the water and rinse the bowl. Repeat the cleaning process until the water remains clean after you've swished the leaves around in it. Gently pat the lettuce dry around and between the leaves to remove as much moisture as possible. Rinse and dry the bowl, and place the lettuce back in it. Season the lettuce with the olive oil and some salt and pepper, and gently toss to combine.\nPrepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.\nRemove the steak from the marinade and let any excess marinade drip off.

    "recipe": "Earl Campbell's Hot Link Gumbo\n2 cups bacon fat\n4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 pound unsalted butter\n1 pound celery, diced\n1 pound onions, diced\n8 ounces green bell peppers, diced\n8 ounces red bell peppers, diced\n2 pounds Earl Campbell's Hot Link Sausage\n5 quarts water\n3/4 cup clam base\n1/2 cup chili powder\n1/2 cup dried thyme\n1 tablespoon chicken base\n1 tablespoon hot sauce, such as Tabasco\n1/2 cup dried oregano\n2 tablespoons granulated garlic\n1 tablespoon paprika\n1 tablespoon cayenne\n1 bay leaf\n3 pounds frozen okra\n1 1/4 ounces gumbo file  \nServing suggestions: steamed rice, soda crackers such as Saltines and Louisiana hot sauce.\nInstructions:\nStart by making the roux. In a heavy bottomed pan, preferably a cast-iron skillet, melt the bacon fat and stir in the flour. It's important to keep stirring this until it turns a deep dark brown. Usually about 30 minutes. Also remember once it is brown to remove it from the burner and it will continue to cook as the pan is still really hot.\nFor the gumbo: Melt the butter in a large pot. Add the celery, onions and green and red bell peppers. Let simmer for 5 minutes. Cut the hot links in 1/4-inch half-moons and add to the pot. Add the water, clam base, chili powder, thyme, oregano, garlic, paprika, cayenne, chicken base, hot sauce and bay leaf. Bring to a boil and turn down to a simmer. Let simmer for 30 minutes. Take 1 cup of the liquid and stir it into the still hot roux; it will expand to double the size. Add this to the gumbo and stir it in well bring it back to a boil. Once it has thickened, turn off the heat and stir in the okra and gumbo file. (At this point you have a nice base that you can add your choice of proteins to, anything from crawfish, shrimp, crab, chicken or a combination.)\nServe in a bowl with steamed rice, soda crackers and Louisiana hot sauce.\n",

It is available throughout the summer.\nGranite is coarse, crystalline ice, made without egg whites or milk products. It is made without an ice cream maker.\nSince granite has a low sugar content, compared to ice cream, it freezes quickly.\nHistory of ice cream: Before the freezer, Italians used to send runners to the mountains to get snow.

Taste the sauce, making sure it's delicious, and then remove the thyme stalk and season with more salt, if needed. The sauce should be thickened and a little chunky.\nLay the Yukon Gold and Cauliflower puree on the bottom of the plate, and then slice the chicken breast and fan the slices on top. Spoon some of the sauce on and around the chicken, and garnish with the supreme clementines.\nHalve the potatoes, and then cut each half into 6 to 8 pieces. Place the potatoes in a pot large enough to hold the cauliflower as well, and then cover the potatoes by 2 inches of water. Sprinkle generously with salt (it should taste like the ocean) and bring to a boil. After the water has been boiling about 10 minutes, add the cauliflower and cook until the vegetables are fork-tender.\nBring the cream to a scald in a small saucepan. Meanwhile, pass the potatoes and cauliflower through a food mill into a large bowl. Add about half of the hot cream and 1/2 of the butter, and stir with purpose until thoroughly combined. Repeat this process with the remaining cream and butter until incorporated. Taste for seasoning (you will probably have to add salt), and serve warm. Yield: 2 servings.\n",

Cut the dough into twelve 4 1/2-inch circles, rerolling the scraps as needed. Arrange on 2 ungreased baking sheets. Bake until the edges are light golden brown, 11 to 14 minutes. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.  \nMeanwhile, combine the confectioners' sugar and meringue powder in a large bowl. Add 5 tablespoons water and beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until the icing forms thick and glossy peaks, adding up to 1 tablespoon more water if needed, about 2 minutes.  \nTransfer 1/4 cup of the icing to a piping bag fitted with a round number 3 tip. Spoon another 1/4 cup of the icing into a small bowl and thin with 1/2 teaspoon water to flooding consistency. You will know it has reached flooding consistency when you run a knife or fork through the icing and it flows back to where it was in 10 seconds. Add more water 1/4 teaspoon at a time until you've reached the right consistency. Transfer to a small piping bag (no tip needed).  \nAdd the food coloring to the remaining icing in the bowl and mix to combine. Transfer 1/4 cup to a piping bag fitted with a round number 3 tip. Thin the remaining blue icing with 1/4 teaspoon water to flooding consistency. You will know it has reached flooding consistency when you run a knife or fork through the icing and it flows back to where it was in 10 seconds. Transfer to a small piping bag (no tip needed).    \nUsing the thick blue icing, pipe the outline of the ocean and some waves on the bottom half of each cookie circle and let dry, about 20 minutes. Fill in the ocean with blue flooding icing using a toothpick to spread it all the way to the edges. Let dry completely, about 30 minutes.  \nOutline the top half of each cookie with the thick white icing. Let dry completely, about 20 minutes. Fill in the empty space on the top half of each cookie with the white flooding icing using a toothpick to spread it all the way to the edges. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon crushed graham crackers over the wet icing on each. Let the icing dry completely, about 30 minutes, then tap the cookies to remove any excess crumbs. Pipe white ocean foam in swirls over the space where the blue and sand meet. Let dry completely, about 20 minutes.  \nMeanwhile, build the sandcastles: Dip 4 mini marshmallows in water, then roll in the graham cracker crumbs until completely covered. Use the thick white icing to stick 3 marshmallows together to form the base of a sandcastle. Pipe a small amount of icing on the bottom of the fourth marshmallow and stick it on top of the base. Repeat with the remaining marshmallows, cracker crumbs and icing to make 12 castles.  \nMake the flags: Use a sharp knife to cut 12 small flags out of the rainbow sour candy. Cut 6 toothpicks in half for the flag poles. Stick each flag to a toothpick piece, then stick a flagpole into the top of each sandcastle.  \nMake the sand buckets: Cut 12 strips from the green taffy, each 1/2 inch long and 1/16 inch wide. Roll 1 strip in your hand to a 1-inch-long rope for a bucket handle. Use thick white icing to glue the handle to a green gumdrop half. Sprinkle some graham cracker crumbs into the top of the gumdrop bucket. Repeat with the remaining taffy strips, icing, gumdrop halves and graham cracker crumbs to make 12 buckets.  \nMake the shovels: Cut 12 strips from the green taffy for the shovel handles, each 1/2 inch long and 1/16 inch wide. Cut twelve 1/4-inch squares from the green taffy. Squeeze one square onto the top of each handle to make 12 shovels.  \nMake the crabs: Use the round part of a number 3 piping tip to cut 12 half-circles out of the red taffy. Cut 72 strips for legs, each 1/6 inch wide and 1/4 inch long. Press 3 legs onto each side of each half-circle to make 12 crabs.  \nMake the seashells: Use a sharp paring knife to cut 2 small pieces off the bottom of each white chocolate chip to create a seashell. Use the paring knife to make indentation lines in the shape of a seashell on top of each chip.  \nAssemble the cookies: Use thick white icing to glue 1 sandcastle, 1 bucket, 1 shovel, 3 seashells and 1 crab to each cookie.

Set aside.\nLine a large work surface with parchment paper and lightly flour the paper. Roll out one ball of the Butter Pie Dough into an 11-by-14-inch rectangle. Gently roll the dough up around your rolling pin and transfer it to a 9-by-12-by-1-inch rectangular sheet pan. Unroll the pastry over the sheet pan. Alternatively, fold the pastry in half and then again in quarters, transfer to the sheet pan and unfold. Gently fit the pastry into the pan and up the sides. Tuck the edges under the side of the pan lip and trim. Transfer the strawberry-chocolate filling to the lined pan and distribute evenly. Place the filled sheet pan in the fridge while you complete the next step.  \nFor the decorations: To make the plain quilt squares, cut a ball of Butter Pie Dough in half and roll one half out to a 7-by-11-inch rectangle. Use a ruler and a crimped pastry wheel (see Cook's Note) to cut six 3-inch squares.    \nTo make the embossed quilt squares: Use the other half of the ball of dough to roll out a 5-by-9-inch rectangle. Place a doily (see Cook's Note) over the pastry and continue to roll the pastry until it is a 7-by-11-inch rectangle. Remove the doily. Use a ruler and the crimped pastry wheel to cut six 3-inch squares. Put the plain and embossed squares carefully on a sheet pan and return to the fridge while you create the other decorations.  \nTo make the cat and mouse decorations: Print the Cat Lady Quilt Pie Template (link below) and cut out the shapes with scissors.  \nRoll out the Chocolate Pie Dough. Lay the front-view cat stencil on the dough and use a sharp knife to cut out a front-view cat; repeat to make 2 front-view cats. Lay the side-view cat stencil on the dough and use a sharp knife to cut out a side-view cat; repeat to make 2 side-view cats. Lay the 2-part mouse stencil on the dough and use a sharp knife to cut out 1 front-end mouse piece and 1 back-end mouse piece.\nTo make the heart, flower, crisscross and letter decorations: Roll out one ball of Butter Pie Dough to a 12-inch circle. Cut out 12 hearts with a 1-inch heart cutter, 11 flowers with a 1-inch flower cutter and 20 crisscrosses with a 1-inch crisscross cutter. Use 1-inch M, E, O and W letter cutters to make 2 Ms, 2 Es, 2 Os and 2 Ws.  \nTo make the fishbone and dream bubble decorations: Using leftover Chocolate Pie Dough, cut a narrow strip of dough for the spine, approximately 1 inch long. Cut 2 narrow strips 1/2 inch long for the cross bones. Cut a triangle for the head of the fish with a 1-inch triangle cutter. Cut a 1/2-inch V shape for the tail.    \nUse any leftover Butter Pie Dough to freehand a dream bubble that is approximately 2 inches wide and 1 inch high. Dampen the dream bubble lightly with a wet finger and assemble the fish on the dream bubble.  \nGently place the quilt squares on the filled pie one at a time, alternating the embossed and plain pieces.    \nTo assemble the decorations: Dampen the back of each decoration right before you place it on a quilt square. The decorations can be arranged in any order that you find appealing, but should be spaced so that patterns are not repeated directly beside each other. Leave one quilt square above a front-view cat quilt square open for the fishbone/dream bubble decoration.  \nFor the cat (side view): On a quilt square, place one side-view cat. Roll 2 small pieces of Butter Pie Dough to form the eyes and place on the face. Repeat on a second quilt square.    \nFor the cat (front view): On a quilt square, place one front-view cat. Roll 2 small pieces of Butter Pie Dough to form the eyes and place on the face. Repeat on a second quilt square.    \nFor the mouse: On a quilt square, place the front end of the mouse. Roll 1 small piece of Butter Pie Dough to form the eye and place on the face. Roll 1 small piece of Chocolate Pie Dough and place on the nose. Put the back end of the mouse on a second quilt square.    \nFor the heart pattern: On a quilt square, form 6 hearts into a circle. Place a flower in the middle. Repeat on a second quilt square.  \nFor the letters: On a quilt square, place one set of letters to spell out MEOW. Repeat on a second quilt square.  \nFor the flowers: On a quilt square, place 9 flowers in 3 rows.  \nFor the fishbone/dream bubble: On an empty quilt square above a front-view cat quilt square, place the assembled fishbone/dream bubble. Roll a few small pieces of Butter Pie Dough and place them above the cat's head leading up to the dream bubble.  \nPlace one crisscross cut-out on each spot where 4 quilt squares meet and where 2 quilt squares meet the border. Use the tines of a fork to create a decorative pattern around the edge of the pie. Trim any excess away from the border.  \nTo bake: Position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.  \nBake the pie for 12 minutes. Then, reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F and bake until the pie is golden and the filling bubbles thickly, another 50 to 60 minutes.

    "recipe": "Mike Mills' Beef Ribs\nFour 2 1/4- to 2 1/2-pound racks center cut beef ribs\nMagic Dust dry rub, recipe follows\nApple City Barbecue Sauce, recipe follows\n4 cups apple juice in a spray bottle\n1/2 cup paprika\n1/4 cup kosher salt, finely ground\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup powdered mustard\n1/4 cup chili powder\n1/4 cup ground cumin\n2 tablespoons ground black pepper\n1/4 cup granulated garlic\n2 tablespoons cayenne pepper\n1 cup ketchup\n2/3 cup seasoned rice vinegar\n1/2 cup apple juice or cider\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n1/4 cup soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce\n2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard\n3/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne\n1/3 cup bacon bits, ground in a spice grinder\n1/3 cup peeled and grated apple\n1/3 cup grated onion\n2 teaspoons grated green bell pepper\nInstructions:\nPrepping the meat: There is a skin-like membrane on the back of the ribs. The easiest way to remove it is to start in the middle of the rack and work a table knife or a screwdriver underneath the skin, going all the way across and teasing it up. Slide your forefinger in there and bring your thumb across, holding the rib down and pulling the membrane straight up. It'll peel from the middle.\nOnce you start cooking the ribs, you can't leave the pit or grill unattended for any more than about 20 minutes. You'll need to continually check that the temperature remains between 250 and 275 degrees F at all times in the grill. If it gets too hot, shut the top and bottom drafts to smother the fire. If some of the coals appear to be glowing red, that will cause a hot spot. Don't cook the ribs directly over the hot spot, move them to a different, cooler, part of the grill. If the temperature dips too low, move the ribs to a hot spot for a while and add some hot coals.\nSprinkle ribs liberally with Magic Dust, coating both sides. Put them in a shallow pan or on a cookie sheet and cover them with clear plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate them until you're ready to use them. I recommend letting them marinate for at least 1 hour. At the restaurant we dust the ribs up to a day in advance.\nPlace ribs on grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. About 10 minutes before you remove the ribs from the grill, mop them with sauce. When you take them off the grill, mop again with sauce and sprinkle some more Magic Dust on them. Serve immediately. Serves 4 very hungry people or you can cut the rack in half to serve 6 to 8 people who have a regular appetite.\nMix all ingredients and store in a tightly covered container. You'll want to keep some in a shaker next to the smoker, grill, or stove. Keeps indefinitely but won't last long.\nCombine the ketchup, rice vinegar, apple juice or cider, cider vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce or Worcestershire sauce, mustard, garlic powder, white pepper, cayenne, and bacon bits in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the apple, onion, and bell pepper. Reduce the heat and simmer, uncovered, 10 to 15 minutes or until it thickens slightly. Stir it often. Allow to cool, then pour into sterilized glass bottles. A clean glass jar that used to contain mayonnaise or juice works real well. Refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.\n",

Bring the water back up to a gentle boil.\nCarefully lift the chicken out using the handles of 2 wooden spoons or 2 pairs of chopsticks positioned under the wings; be careful not to tear the skin (do not use tongs as they can easily tear the skin).

    "recipe": "Portuguese-Style Pan-Fried Hake\n2 medium ripe tomatoes (12 ounces)\n3 tablespoons olive oil, preferably Portuguese\n2 bay leaves\n3 whole allspice berries, cracked and finely chopped\n3 or 4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 medium green bell pepper (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced\n1 medium onion (about 6 ounces), thinly sliced\n1/4 cup dry white wine\n1/2 cup small black Portuguese or nicoise olives, pitted and rinsed\nKosher or sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup olive oil, preferably Portuguese\n1 1/2 to 2-pounds hake fillets, trimmed, deboned and skinned; cut into 4 (6 to 8-ounce) portions\nKosher or sea salt freshly ground black pepper\n2 cups cornmeal\nInstructions:\nFill the saucepan halfway with water and bring it to boil over high heat. Score an x at the base of each tomato with a small paring knife. Lower the tomatoes into the boiling water until the skin splits, about 30 seconds. Plunge them into ice water after blanching to stop the cooking. Peel skins from the tomatoes, and cut them in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds, cut the tomatoes into a 1/3-inch slivers (julienne) and set them aside. There will be about 1 1/2 cups.\nYou should start the sauce about 15 minutes before you want to serve the fish, so start heating up the larger skillet (for the fish) on a medium heat at the same time you begin the sauce. Place the smaller skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil (3 tablespoons) and the bay leaves. Cook the bay leaves until they are lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the allspice and garlic and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Add the bell pepper and onion and saute, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are golden, about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, white wine and olives. Simmer until the sauce is fragrant and has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper and remove from heat.\nJust before you add the tomatoes to the sauce, add the olive oil (1/4 cup) to the preheated large skillet. Quickly season all the fillets with salt and pepper on both sides. Spread the cornmeal into a shallow bowl and dredge the fish portions in the cornmeal, 1 at a time, pressing to make the cornmeal adhere and then gently shaking off the excess. Work quickly and put each fillet into hot oil as you prepare them. As soon as the cornmeal appears to darken, turn the heat down a bit. The key is to have them cooking evenly so that when you turn the fillet, it should be a perfect golden brown. It will take about 3 to 4 minutes per side. The thicker the fish, the slower you should cook it. Turn the fillets, and cook for another 3 or 4 minutes until crisp and golden brown. Using a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to individual plates or to a platter. Divide the sauce by draping a small amount of the chunky sauce over the fish and spooning the remaining sauce around it. Serve immediately.\n",

Remove teabags and add sweetener to taste. Stir in 6 cups ice cubes until melted. Keep refrigerated until ready to use. Makes two quarts. For the pizza dough: Heat 1/4 cup of the olive oil and the garlic in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the garlic is softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cool slightly.  \nWhisk the water and sugar together in a bowl; sprinkle the yeast over top. Set aside until foamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in the olive oil-garlic mixture.  \nWhisk the flour and 2 teaspoons salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Gradually stir with a wooden spoon to make a rough dough.  \nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes, dusting with more flour as necessary. Form into a large ball. Brush a large bowl with olive oil, add the dough and turn to coat. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.  \nMeanwhile, adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and preheat to 450 degrees F. Put a baking sheet on the rack to heat up while the dough rises. (The baking sheet should be the same size or slightly larger than the baking sheet that you will later form the dough on.)  \nOnce the dough has doubled in size, brush a rimmed baking sheet generously with half of the remaining olive oil. Put the dough onto the oiled baking sheet and stretch and pat evenly into the pan, making sure that it reaches the edges. Use your fingertips to make dimples all over the dough. Brush with the remaining olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt. Arrange the tomato slices on the pizza in a single layer, making sure that each bite will have a piece of tomato. Sprinkle the tomatoes lightly with salt. Place the baking sheet with the dough directly on top of the preheated baking sheet in the oven (this helps with a crispy crust). Bake for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheets and sprinkle the Parmesan over the dough. Continue to bake until the dough is golden brown and the cheese is melted, 10 to 15 minutes.  \nFor the Caesar salad: Meanwhile, whisk together the honey, anchovies, garlic, lemon zest and juice and egg yolk in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, then season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper.  \nRemove the pizza from the oven and transfer to a large platter or cutting board. Toss the romaine with the dressing. Season with additional salt and pepper if needed. Top the pizza with the salad. Use a vegetable peeler to shave ribbons of Parmesan over the salad.

Mix together using a rubber spatula or knead together with your hands. Squeeze a small handful of the mixture in your hand. It should hold together. If it doesn't and the mixture is crumbly, knead in the remaining 1/2 ounce cream cheese.\nForm three roughly ball-shaped pieces from the mixture that are small, medium and large as the segments of a snowman.

Add the two chocolate sprinkles just over the eyes for eyebrows. Press the nose into the face just under the eyes and add the larger chocolate chip (flat side out) for an o-shaped mouth. Break the pretzel stick in half and add to each side of the body, with one arm sticking upright and the other onto the lower part of the body as if it has melted off. Add the three remaining mini chocolate chips for buttons down the front of the snowman body. Add a licorice lace scarf around the neck.\nCut the fun-size candy bar in half and have ready on hand with the vanilla cookie.\nHeat the dark chocolate in the microwave at 100 percent power at 30-second intervals until melted and smooth.

    "recipe": "Chinese-Style Dumplings\n4 cups all-purpose flour\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 cups hot water\n2 boneless duck breasts and legs with skin, put through meat grinder fitted with medium blade\n1 cup finely chopped savoy cabbage  \n3 tablespoons freshly chopped scallions\n2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves\n2 tablespoons freshly chopped chives\n1 egg, lightly beaten\n2 tablespoons chili paste\n1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 teaspoon ground ginger\n1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper  \n1 cup black vinegar\n1/4 cup rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons hoisin sauce\n2 tablespoons fresh lime juice\n1 tablespoon chili paste\n2 tablespoons freshly chopped cilantro leaves\n2 tablespoons freshly chopped mint leaves\n1 tablespoon freshly chopped Thai basil leaves\n1/2 habanero pepper, minced\nPeanut oil, for cooking  \nLime wedges, for garnish\nCilantro leaves, for garnish\nInstructions:\nFor the dough: Whisk the flour with the salt and stir in the water until dough is shaggy. Turn onto a lightly floured board and knead briefly; dough should be soft and pliable but not too sticky. Rest, covered, while you make the filling and the sauce.\nPlace all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix until thoroughly combined. To check for seasoning, fry a bit in some hot oil until just cooked through. Adjust the seasoning as necessary.\nFor the sauce:\nCombine all but the last 2 ingredients in a bowl for dipping. Sprinkle the basil and habanero over the top.\nTo Assemble and Cook:\nFlour your work surface lightly and roll the dough, or pieces of it, about 1/8-inch thick (too thin and the dough will tear as you fill the dumplings). Cut out circles with a 3-inch round cutter. Cover the dough with a side towel or piece of plastic wrap as you work. Have a small bowl of water next to you. Place a scant tablespoon of filling in the middle of a dough circle, and press it so that it spreads slightly toward the side edges of the dough. Using your fingertip or a small pastry brush, wet the edge of the dough. Fold the dough up around the filling so that the filling sits on the work surface-that's the bottom of your dumpling-and the seam is between your fingers. Pleat the dough that is facing you, about 6 times, pressing it against the back to seal-only the front of the dumpling should be pleated. The corners of the dumpling should curl slightly away from you, toward the unpleated side. Heat a skillet, just large enough to accommodate the number of dumplings you want to cook over high heat. Add a thin coating of oil, heat, then add the dumplings in concentric circles. They should be touching. Cook until the bottoms are golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes (reduce the heat if they are browning too quickly). Add enough water to come about 1/4 of the way up the sides of the dumplings-it will spatter. Cover the skillet, adjust the heat so that the water is simmering, and cook for about 7 minutes. Uncover the skillet and, if there is water left, let it cook off. Check the dumpling bottoms-if they need to brown a bit more, let them, adding a bit more oil if necessary. Serve the dumplings immediately, drizzled with some dipping sauce and garnished with cilantro and lime wedges.\n",

It should all be finely crumbled and there should not be any big chunks left.     \nCombine the crumbled tofu, beef, pork, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, scallion and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Mix with your hands until the ingredients are well incorporated and the mixture comes together.       \nScoop the meat mixture into 18 to 20 meatballs (about 1 1/2 tablespoons each; see Cook's Note), placing them on a large baking sheet or plate. Roll each portion into a ball, then flatten into a 1/2-inch-thick patty, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter.     \nAdd the flour to a large rimmed plate and whisk the eggs in a medium bowl. Heat a large nonstick skillet with 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium-low heat.    \nDredge each patty in the flour, coating well on all sides. Smooth out any rough, uneven edges and shape the patty neatly. Working with one at a time, shake off excess flour, then dip and roll the patty around in the egg, making sure to coat thoroughly with no flour peeping through. (All the patties can be dredged and sitting in flour, but be sure to dip the patties in the egg one at a time.) Gently place the egg-coated patty in the heated skillet -- most of the egg will drip off to the bottom, creating a desirable \\u201cskirt\\u201d that will be served on top. (Do not move the patties around as the top needs to be clean and free of brown bits.) Repeat to add 8 or 9 more patties, or as many as will fit in the skillet without crowding.    \nCook without disturbing until the patties are light golden underneath, 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until the other side is light golden, 4 to 5 minutes more.  \nTransfer the cooked patties to a baking sheet fitted with a wire rack and keep warm in the oven.    \nWipe the skillet clean with a paper towel and heat another 3 tablespoons oil over medium-low heat before cooking the next batch of patties.    \nFor the dipping sauce: Combine the soy sauce, vinegar, 2 tablespoons water, sugar and gochugaru (if using) in a small bowl and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Serve with the wanjajeon.    \n",

Press the handle of a wooden spoon against the pastry all round the edges to coax it into the fluted grooves.

    "recipe": "Spicy Sausage Ragu Nachos With Pickled Onions\n3 cloves garlic, smashed\n2 stalks celery, diced\n2 onions, diced\n1 small fennel bulb, top and core removed, diced\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\n2 cups tomato paste\n2 cups hearty red wine\n2 pounds spicy Italian sausage, casings removed\n2 bay leaves\n1 bunch thyme, tied with butcher's twine\n3/4 cup red wine vinegar\n1 1/2 tablespoons sugar\nKosher salt\n2 to 3 dashes hot sauce (such as Tabasco)\n1 red onion, sliced into thin rings\n1 large bag corn tortilla chips\n1/2 to 3/4 cup grated parmigiano-reggiano cheese\n1/2 to 3/4 cup grated fontina cheese\n1 chipotle chile in adobo sauce, chopped, plus 1 1/2 teaspoons sauce from the can\n1/2 cup (4 ounces) mascarpone cheese\n1 cup packed arugula\nInstructions:\nMake the ragu: Put the garlic, celery, onions and fennel in a food processor and puree to make a coarse paste. Coat a wide, deep pan with the olive oil and put over medium-high heat. Add the pureed veggies and season with salt; cook until all the liquid has evaporated and the veggies begin to stick to the pan-you want to brown the crap out of these guys until crud starts to form on the bottom of the pan. Stir occasionally to scrape up the browned bits, then let the crud form again. Be patient here and don't rush it: This is where the big flavor develops; it will take up to 30 minutes.\nWhen the lovely brown crud has formed and been scraped down a couple of times, stir in the tomato paste. Let it start to brown a little, stirring, 2 to 3 minutes. There's not much liquid at this point to keep things from burning, so move fast: Add the wine, stir to combine and scrape up any remaining browned bits. Cook until about half of the wine has evaporated, 4 to 5 minutes.\nAdd the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. (This is where another round of big flavor is formed, so take your time.)\nAdd enough water to cover the meat by about 1/2 inch. Stir to combine well, then add the bay leaves and thyme bundle. Taste, season with salt and taste again; it's by no means done, but it should taste good. Bring the sauce to a boil (BTB) and reduce to a simmer (RTS). Continue cooking for 3 hours, tasting, seasoning and adding more water as needed. Discard the bay leaves and thyme.\nMeanwhile, make the pickled onions: Combine the vinegar, 1/2 cup cold water, the sugar, 1 tablespoon salt and the hot sauce in a bowl. Add the sliced onion and let sit, at least 1 hour. Drain.\nAssemble the nachos: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spread a layer of tortilla chips on an ovenproof platter. Top with a layer of the ragu and cover with the parmigiano and fontina cheeses. Bake until the cheeses melt, 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the chopped chipotle, adobo sauce and mascarpone in a bowl. Sprinkle the arugula over the nachos and finish with dollops of the chipotle mascarpone and the pickled onions. A gooey cheesy treat. Delish.\n",

In a large bowl, combine the miso, soy sauce, 1/4 cup hot water, mirin, canola oil, rice vinegar and sesame oil. Whisk together well and set aside.\nIn a large pot of salted boiling water, blanch the sugar snap peas until bright green and just tender, 10 to 15 seconds. Set aside. Add the soba noodles to the hot water and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Then strain and rinse under cold running water (this will stop the cooking process and gives the soba noodles their distinctive springy texture). Toss the noodles in the dressing and fold in the sugar snap peas and julienned carrot. Set aside until ready to serve.\nFor the seared ahi tuna: In a large mixing bowl, make a quick marinade of the canola oil, sweet soy sauce, yuzu, sesame oil and ginger. Whisk together to combine. Carefully cut the tuna into 1 1/2-inch cubes and place in the marinade and toss to coat well (it will be a very light coating/marinade as the tuna shouldn't be too wet when searing).\nThread 4 pieces of tuna per bamboo skewer (4 cubes per skewer, 8 skewers total). Mix the sesame seeds together and spread out on a flat platter. Take each skewer and press the tuna into the sesame seed mixture so it is well coated on all 4 sides.\nHeat a flat grill plate to high heat. Brush lightly with some oil to clean the grates and create a nonstick surface. Grill the tuna skewers just a few seconds on each of the 4 sides so the sesame seeds are toasted and crunchy and the tuna is rare in the middle, 30 to 35 seconds.\nServe the tuna skewers on a bed of the dressed soba noodles and garnish with some sliced scallions.\n",

    "recipe": "Wild Mushroom and Fonduta Ravioli with Asparagus, Butter and Parmigiano\n1 pound Fresh Pasta Dough\n1 recipe Mushroom Filling\n1/2 cup Fonduta\n1 egg yolk\nSemolina flour to dust\n1 tablespoon butter\n1/2 cup fresh asparagus (green and white), blanched, cooled and cut into 1-inch pieces\n2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese\n3 1/2 cups flour (all-purpose or \\0-0\\)\n4 eggs\n1 teaspoon olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1 pound assorted wild mushrooms, cleaned and chopped (save stems and peelings)\n1 teaspoon garlic, finely chopped\n1/4 cup white wine\n1/2 teaspoon fresh parsley, chopped\n1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh sage\nSalt and pepper to taste\n1 cup Porcini Mushroom Stock or vegetable stock\nWhite truffle oil (optional)\n2 ounces dried porcini pieces\n5 cups cold water\n1 pound Italian Fontina cheese\n1 1/2 cups milk\n6 egg yolks\n1 teaspoon flour\nInstructions:\nFor the Fresh Pasta Dough: Place the flour on a work surface. Make a well in the center and add the eggs, olive oil and salt. Begin mixing the eggs with a fork, being careful to stay in the center. Add flour from the sides of the well little by little. When it becomes too stiff to mix with a fork, continue, incorporating flour by gently kneading the dough.\nWhen the dough has absorbed about as much flour as it's going to, move it to another area of the counter, scrape up the remaining flour and pass it through a sifter to remove any dried bits (you don't want these in your dough.)\nThen start kneading, keeping the table lightly dusted with flour. When it no longer sticks to the table, you're about finished. In the end, you want a smooth, firm but resilient, homogenous ball of dough, neither too dry nor too soft. Poke the dough and it should spring right back, press your fingers into the middle of the ball and it should feel just a bit tacky. If it is very sticky, you'll need to add more flour.\nWrap the dough loosely in plastic and let it rest for at least 1 hour. This will make it easier to roll out.\nFor the Mushroom Filling: Heat the oil in a frying pan add the mushrooms and saute. Add the garlic and deglaze with the white wine.\nWhen the wine has cooked away, add the mushroom stock and simmer until almost all the liquid has evaporated.\nLet the mushrooms cool then pulse in a food processor until coarsely chopped. In a mixing bowl, fold in the herbs and season with salt and pepper to taste. You can also stir in a drop of truffle oil if desired.\nFor the Porcini Mushroom Stock: Place porcini in a saucepot and cover with water. Bring to a boil then lower heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the mushroom steep for 30 to 40 minutes.\nPass the stock through a strainer lined with a cheesecloth or a dampened paper towel to remove the mushrooms and any bits of sand.\nYou should have 4 cups of flavorful, not overly concentrated, stock.\nFor the Fonduta: Trim the red rind off the cheese and chop in a food processor. Put the cheese in a stainless steel mixing bowl, pour the milk over the cheese, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate over night. Fill a saucepan halfway with water and bring to boil. Place the mixing bowl over the pot to create a double boiler and allow the cheese to dissolve slowly into the milk, whisking occasionally.\nWhen the milk and cheese are completely amalgamated, stir in the flour. Whisk in the egg yolks one at a time. When all the eggs have been incorporated continue whisking over the heat until the mixture is thick and creamy and warm to the touch. Be careful not to let the fonduta get to hot or it will curdle.\nFor the Ravioli: Using a pasta rolling machine or rolling pin, roll pasta out into a very thin sheet 6 to 8 inches wide. Spoon the mushroom filling on to half of the sheet in 2 rows of even rounds. Make a small indentation in the center of each mound and, with a pastry bag or small spoon, place a little of the fonduta into the center of each mound. Brush a little of the egg yolk around the mushroom filling then carefully lay the other half of the pasta sheet over the top. Gently press around the filling. Using a scalloped pastry wheel, cut the pasta in between the mounds to form individual ravioli. Keep the ravioli on a board or pan sprinkled with flour until ready to cook. (May be made and kept in refrigerator up to a day in advance). Bring a pot of salted water to a boil add the ravioli and cook 3 to 5 minutes; when the pasta rises to the surface they are done. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Add the asparagus, a pinch of salt. Add the ravioli, toss with the Parmigiano cheese and serve.\n",

Continue until all of the cookie dough has been used.    \nAfter cooling completely, decorate the cookies using royal icing or glaze.    \nTo decorate with royal icing: Transfer 1/2 cup of royal icing to a piping bag with a #2 metal piping tip (small round tip). Pipe as desired--the royal icing will need about 1 hour to dry, or overnight if you plan to pack them for shipping. Add additional royal icing to the piping bag as needed.  \nTo decorate with glaze: Dip the top half of the cookie into the glaze. Sprinkle the cookies with colored sugar as desired.

It should take only a minute or two. You want a nice, moist dough, so work in a little more warm water if it's dry. If it's sticky, work in a little more masa harina.\nBreak the dough into four equal pieces and roll each one into a ball. Put the balls on a plate or cutting board and cover them with plastic wrap to keep the dough from drying out. One at a time, roll them out with a rolling pin or clean wine bottle until they're a thin circle about 1/4-inch thick. Brush a little of the vegetable oil on a skillet or comal and heat it over medium-high heat until it's good and hot. Carefully add the first sope and cook it until little brown blisters appear on the bottom, about 45 seconds. Flip it over with a spatula and cook for another 30 to 45 seconds. Flip it over again, count to 10 and transfer to the towel-lined baking sheet. Keep it warm in the oven. Repeat with the remaining 3 sopes (adding a little more oil if you need to), and keep them in the oven until you're ready to serve them.\nPour a couple of tablespoons of the oil into a skillet and add the chile, garlic and onions. Set the skillet over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Add the huitlacoche (or mushrooms) along with a good pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the huitlacoche is heated through, about 5 minutes (or until the mushrooms are a little browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes). Take the mixture off the heat and stir in the cilantro.\nArrange your sopes on a platter. Cover with a thin layer of Roasted Tomato-Chile de Arbol Salsa, the huitlacoche or mushrooms, a drizzle of the crema fresca and a sprinkle of queso fresco. Serve the remaining salsa on the side.\nPreheat the boiler.\nPut the tomatoes on a baking sheet and broil until the tomatoes are nice and charred, 10 to 12 minutes. Take the tomatoes out, let them cool just until you can handle them, slip off the skins and cut out the tough cores. Transfer the tomatoes to a big bowl (don't you dare forget the tomato juice that has leaked out and reduced to awesomeness on the baking sheet), and then roughly chop them.\nWhile the tomatoes are broiling, heat a dry skillet over medium heat and toast the chiles (in batches, if necessary), flipping them over occasionally, until they just begin to smoke, about 5 minutes. Set them aside in a bowl.\nPut the olive oil, garlic and onions in a saucepan, set it over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft, about 7 minutes. Add the toasted chiles, tomatoes and 2 cups water, bring to a simmer and cook for another 12 minutes, so the flavors come together. Let it cool a bit.\nCarefully transfer the mixture to a blender. Add the cilantro, salt and pepper and puree until the mixture is very smooth. Pour the mixture through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled. Store the salsa in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to a week, or in the freezer for a month.\n",

Place slices on a towel and dry. In a pan, heat the oil over medium heat and add the potato slices. The oil should not be very hot, you want to blanch the potatoes, but they should not have any color. Drain and dry the potatoes. Increase the heat of the oil.  \nPlace 1 cilantro leaf onto a potato slice and cover with another slice of potato. Press the two slices together firmly, and fry quickly until crispy. Drain and set aside. Repeat this process until you have enough to serve your guests.  \nTo make the pea puree, sweat the onions for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and sweat for another 1 minute. Add the wine, and reduce by half. Once the liquid has reduced, add the cream and reduce until sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon. Defrost the peas, and add them to the cream mixture. Using a blender, puree mixture, set aside and keep warm.  \nFor the herb salad: Make the dressing by combining the vinegar, lime juice, and extra-virgin olive oil. Toss all of the herbs in the dressing and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.  \nFor the saffron sauce, combine the chopped onion, carrots, leeks, and white wine in a saucepan, and reduce by 3/4. Once the liquid has reduced, add the heavy cream and the saffron, and let reduce further until sauce has thickened, approximately 10 minutes on medium heat. Pass the sauce through a strainer and return to the saucepot. On low heat, slowly add small pieces of the butter, constantly stirring the sauce. Set sauce aside and keep warm.  \nTo make the tempura batter, mix together the egg yolk, flour, wine, and water, and stir, making sure there are no lumps. Do not overmix the batter.  \nIn a large pot, heat the oil to 350 degrees F.  \nTo prepare the fish, dip the fish pieces into the tempura batter. Fry the fish for approximately 10 minutes, or until light golden brown. Remove the fish and drain on paper towels. Season with salt while the fish is still hot.  \nTo serve, place the fish pieces on each plate. Add the herb salad to the side of the fish. Place a small spoonful of pea puree on the plate and drizzle some saffron sauce around the plate. Serve with Coriander Chips and drizzle with basil oil.\n",

    "recipe": "Mojo Criollo Roasted Pig\n1 garlic head\n6 ounces orange juice\n2 ounces lemon juice\n2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 tablespoon chopped oregano leaves\n3 teaspoons salt\n4 ounces water\n1 (75-pound) pig\nInstructions:\nMake marinade: peel and mash the garlic cloves. Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Let stand for a minimum of 1 hour. Strain marinade and then inject the marinade into the pig. Let marinate overnight, in the refrigerator, for best results.  \nOpen the pork by the belly, but do not cut or poke holes into the upper or side skin. Place the grease tray inside the Caja China. Tie the pig in between the grids, on its back, and place in the grease tray. Close the Caja China with the ash pan and charcoal grid. Allow 4 inches of separation between the roast and the ash pan. We recommend the pork be at room temperature at the time of roasting.  \nPrepare the charcoal: we recommend Kingsford Charcoal because it lights faster, burns evenly, and lasts longer. Never use instant charcoal. Start with 14 pounds of charcoal for Caja China Model #1 and 16 pounds for Model #2. Place the charcoal into 2 piles of equal size, on each end of the charcoal tray. Never place charcoal on center of tray. Add lighter fluid and light.  \nWhen the charcoal is lit for 15 minutes, distribute it evenly throughout the tray. Once this process is completed, roast pork for 3 hours, without opening the Caja China. Add more charcoal after 1 hour and distribute evenly throughout the tray. After 3 hours, wearing heavy-duty silicone mitts, remove the charcoal tray, ash pan, and dump the ashes. Then turn the pork over and cut into the skin, every 4 to 6 inches. Place the ash pan and charcoal tray, filled with new charcoal, back into position and continue the roasting process. Check the skin after 20 minutes, slightly opening the box by 1 of the corners. You can continue this process until the skin's crispness is to your liking. For a pig this large, it will probably require a full hour on its second side.  \nRemove the pork from the Caja China. Deposit the contents of the grease tray into a container, let cool, and discard with trash. You can slice the pork with a plate; it is not necessary to use a knife.  \n",

Lightly coat a baking pan with cooking spray.\nIn a small saucepan, combine the butter and chopped chocolate and set over very low heat until melted. Stir the mixture and set aside to cool. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Measure the sugar into the large bowl of an electric mixer and beat in the cooled butter-chocolate mixture. Add the egg plus whites, vanilla, and water and beat well. Add the dry ingredients and mix on low speed just until blended. Don't overbeat. The batter will be thick. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top, and bake for 22 to 25 minutes; 23 minutes is usually right for me. When done, the top will look dry and a wooden pick inserted near the edge will come out with a few crumbs but the center will look slightly gooey. Cool in the pan and cut into squares.\nI have been trying for a couple of years to produce a brownie worthy of the name with less fat and less solid chocolate. My taste testers finally agree that this is it - a great brownie they would never suspect of being lower in anything. I have cut the classic 58 percent down to 31 percent calories from fat and eliminated 87 calories, 10 g fat, and 22 mg cholesterol from each brownie.\nWhen traditional proportions are disrupted, textures become moist and cakey at best or dry, insipid, and tough at worst. One rule emerges clearly: The fewer ingredients, the better the brownie. Avoid the usual low-fat stand-ins: applesauce, yogurt, corn syrup, canola oil. Use butter, but less, and replace most of the solid chocolate with rich-tasting Dutch-processed cocoa; retain at least 1 ounce of solid chocolate, however, for a more complex chocolate taste. A few tricks: Cake flour produced a more tender crumb than all-purpose, and melting the butter with the chocolate, as opposed to creaming the solid butter with the sugar, gave a fudgier crumb. A touch of baking powder seems to enhance the crunch of the top crust.\nFaced with the choice of adding high-fat chopped nuts or keeping the 1/4 cup butter, there was no contest; nuts put us over the top in fat content. However, if you feel deprived without them, sprinkle about 3 tablespoons of finely chopped walnuts on top before baking; the changes are modest: 33 percent calories from fat, plus 9 calories and 1g fat per brownie.\n",

Place the butter in a small bowl and stir in the garlic, shallots, parsley, lemon juice and salt. Cut the shrimp in half lengthwise, leaving them attached at the tail. Spread the shrimp open and arrange them in a shallow, oval flameproof casserole. Top the shrimp with generous dabs of the butter mixture and pour fumet or water into the dish. Broil the shrimp until they are cooked through, about 4 minutes. Arrange the shrimp in a line across 4 plates, so that the tail of each shrimp fits inside the shrimp in front of it. Whisk the liquid in the casserole dish and pour it over the shrimp. Serve immediately.\nRemove the gills and eyes from the fish or have your fish store do it. Cut the heads and bones across into 4-inch pieces. Put them in a shallow pan and cover with cold water. Let stand for 1 hour, changing the water twice. Drain. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, fennel, leek, peppercorns, salt, parsley and bay leaf. Turn the heat to medium-low and cook until the vegetables are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add the fish bones and cook, stirring from time to time, until the bones and any flesh around the bones turn from translucent to white, about 12 minutes. Add the wine and water and bring to a boil. Boil for 10 minutes, skimming off the foam as it rises to the top. Remove from the heat and let rest for 10 minutes. Strain the fumet through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing firmly on the solids to extract as much of the flavorful liquid as possible. If you have more than 3 cups of fumet, place the liquid in a clean saucepan and boil until reduced to 3 cups. Store, tightly covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.  \n",

    "recipe": "Classic Potato Latkes\n2 medium to large yellow or Vidalia onions, quartered\n3 jumbo eggs  \n4 1/2 teaspoons powdered golden consomme    \n1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper  \n5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes    \n3/4 to 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, depending on wetness of the batter  \nNeutral oil, for frying (I use canola)  \nSour cream and chives or homemade applesauce, for serving  \nInstructions:\nAdd the onions to a food processor and process with the standard blade until smooth. Add the eggs and process until light in color. Add the golden consomme and white pepper and blend on high until you have an even mush with no pieces of onion visible. Transfer the onion mush to a mixing bowl.\nPeel the potatoes and cut a third of them into quarters. Put the quartered potatoes in the food processor and blend until an even mush is achieved. Add the potato mush to the mixing bowl.  \nThis is a good time to start heating your frying pan(s) on very low heat with NO OIL!  \nSwitch to the food processor shredding disc and shred the remaining potatoes in batches if necessary. Before you add the shredded potatoes to the mixing bowl, take the potatoes by the handful and squeeze out as much water as possible over the sink. Add the squeezed potatoes to the mixing bowl--breaking them apart as you add them--and mix them in after every 2 to 3 handfuls. This will help evenly incorporate the mush and shreds for a consistent batter that is seasoned evenly as well. Use your strong spoon! Add 3/4 cup flour and mix; the batter is the right consistency when you don't see a lot of water collecting across the top. Add more flour a bit at a time, just enough to not have a watery mix.  \nTurn the pan(s) up to medium-high or high heat (for a heavier pan). When a drop of water in the pan sizzles and pops, the pan is hot enough to add about 3/4 inch of oil. Heat the oil to between 375 and 400 degrees F.    \nBefore you start a big batch, make a few \\tester latkes\\ to taste so you can adjust the seasoning. How many you make will depend on how many \\experts\\ you have hanging around waiting for a \\tester.\\  \nKnow the size of latke you want to make. I make larger ones if they are part of a meal and smaller ones if they are being served as an appetizer or being sent to school for a holiday party. Smaller ones should be about 1 tablespoon and larger ones should be about a serving spoon of batter.  \nThink to yourself \\thin and crispy\\ while you spoon the batter into the pan and flatten. Don't crowd the pan. The shredded edges may touch, but that's ok.  \nCook the latkes until the bottoms are golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes on the first side. You can't rush perfection--the middle has to cook. Don't make the heat so high that the outside burns but the middle is uncooked. Put on your favorite music or have someone you love keep you company!    \nFlip when the bottoms are golden brown. Flipping tip: Putting a spatula under the latke using your dominant hand and a fork on top of the latke with your other hand will give you a controlled flip that won't splash you with oil. Cook on the second side until the bottoms are golden brown, another 3 to 4 minutes.  \nLine a baking dish with paper towels. Place the cooked latkes on the lined baking dish on their sides (like a tray of Oreos); this will let the oil drain and keep them from getting soggy. If you have a lot of counter space, feel free to use a wire rack and then stack sideways. Foods cooked in oil are a part of the Chanukah story.    \nMix the batter before each batch to keep everything well incorporated. Repeat and repeat and repeat and beware \\experts\\ looking for more \\testers.\\ If you need to add more oil to the pans, do it between batches and give it a minute to heat up. The latkes can be kept in a low oven to keep warm or the baking dish can be put in the oven at 350 degrees F to heat from room temperature. Serve with sour cream and chives or homemade applesauce.  \nB'tayavon (Bon Appetit).\n",

To soak up the gorgeous juices, and to serve as a fantastically quicktime potato substitute, I serve up gnocchi alongside. You could always add a little lemony fennel, sliced thinly, or a green salad if you're in the mood.\nCut the fat or rind off the chops, and then bash them briefly but brutally with a rolling pin between 2 pieces of cling film/plastic wrap to make them thinner.\nHeat the oil in a pan, and then cook the chops over a moderately-high heat for about 5 minutes a side. Remove them to a warmed plate.\nPour the cider into the pan, still over the heat, to deglaze the pan. Let it bubble away for a minute or so then add the mustard and stir in the cream.\nLet the sauce continue cooking for a few minutes before pouring over each plated pork chop. If you're having gnocchi with, make sure you turn them in the pan to absorb any spare juices before adding them to your plates.\n",

(If your grill has a thermometer, aim to keep the temperature at about 350 degrees F throughout grilling.) Cook the poblano and bell peppers on the grill, turning occasionally, until completely charred on the outside, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a plate to steam for about 10 minutes.\nMeanwhile, grill the onions until golden and soft, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Peel the poblano and bell peppers and remove and discard the stems and skins. Cut the flesh into 1/2-inch strips and set aside. (Keep the poblano strips separate from bell pepper strips.)\nSet the steak on a cutting board. Using a long thin knife and starting at the thin, narrow end of the steak, slice it in half horizontally leaving 2 inches of the meat uncut at the wide end of the steak so the pieces stay attached. Open it up like a book so you have one long piece. Pound the steak with a meat mallet to an even thickness of about 1/4 inch.\nArrange the steak flat on a work surface with a long side facing you. Combine the cilantro, tomato paste, oil, cumin, oregano, scallions and 2 teaspoons salt in a bowl. Spread the paste all over the top of the steak. Working in three batches, arrange vertical stripes of the poblanos, bell peppers, onions, and olives on the steak until the steak is covered, leaving 2 inches empty at each end.\nRoll up the steak like a jelly roll, starting at one of the short ends. Tie the steak closed around the circumference with butcher's twine at 2-inch intervals. Tie one more piece of twine lengthwise around the steak.\nPut the steak on the direct heat side of the grill and cook, turning, to brown all 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Move the steak to the indirect heat side of the grill, cover and cook, turning occasionally, until the center of the steak registers 115 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, 25 to 30 minutes for a steak that is well-done on the outside and medium-rare in the center. (Test frequently; the time will vary based on the temperature of your grill.) Let the steak rest about 10 minutes.\nUntie the steak and cut it into 6 thick slices.  \n",

    "recipe": "Maple Buttermilk Tart\n1 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting\n2 tablespoons fine stone ground cornmeal\n2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar\n2 tablespoons superfine sugar\nPinch fine salt\n6 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cut into 6 pieces\n1 large egg yolk, lightly beaten\nGranulated or sanding sugar, for garnish, optional\n2/3 cup maple sugar\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\nPinch fine salt\n5 tablespoons butter, melted and slightly cooled\n3/4 cup buttermilk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten\nInstructions:\nFor the crust: Pour the flour, cornmeal, sugars and salt into the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade and process to combine. Scatter the butter over the top and pulse with the dry mixture to coat, and then continue pulsing until cool and almost sandy, about eight 3-second pulses. Drizzle the yolk over the top, and pulse again until the ingredients are moist and barely starting to clump, about another 8 pulses. The dough should just hold together when you squeeze it in your palm. If not, add 1 teaspoon of cold water and pulse briefly.  \nTurn the dough out onto a lightly-floured work surface. Smear out the dough across the work surface using the heel of your hand until it begins to come together. Gather the dough back together and shape it into a disc. Wrap in plastic and chill for 1 hour.  \nLet the dough warm up slightly before rolling it out (if you roll it while it is cold, it will crack). Roll the dough on a lightly-floured work surface with a rolling pin into a 1/8 to 3/16-inch-thick circles, 10 to 11 inches in diameter. Fit the dough into an 8-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Don't worry if it cracks a bit; you can patch it with some of the trimmings. Press the dough firmly into the bottom of the pan where it meets the sides, and then roll the rolling pin across the pan to cut off the overhang. Press the dough firmly against the sides of the pan and back up to the top using your fingers (sometimes the rolling pin pushes the dough down the sides of the pan a bit). Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.  \nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Position the rack on the lowest rung of the oven and put a baking sheet on top. Line the chilled crust with a 10-inch coffee filter and weight it down with dried beans or rice. Place on the hot baking sheet and bake until the sides begin to turn golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the shell from the oven, carefully remove the beans and filter and then return to the oven until completely golden brown and baked through, another 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 325 degrees F. Let cool before adding the filling, about 10 minutes.  \nFor the filling: Pulse the maple sugar, flour and salt in a food processor until combined. Add the melted butter and pulse to combine, and then add the buttermilk and vanilla and pulse to combine again. Add the eggs and pulse until just combined-don't over-mix. Strain into the tart shell. Bake the tart until the sides are set (they may puff slightly) and the middle still jiggles slightly when you tap the pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a rack for at least 45 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature, garnished with cookies as desired.\n",

Remove and let cool.\nAssemble: Using a paring knife, hollow out a hole in the bottom of each of the puffs. Pipe the pastry cream into the hole. Alternatively, you can cut the top off each puff and remove any undercooked dough in the center, then fill with the pastry cream and top with the top again. Hold in the refrigerator until ready to garnish and serve.\nMake the chocolate sauce: In a small pot, heat the cream. In a small bowl that fits over the pot of cream (without the bottom of the bowl touching the cream), combine the chocolate with the cinnamon. Use the pot of cream as the bottom of the double boiler and melt the chocolate over the cream. When the chocolate is melted, add the heated cream to the bowl with the chocolate and whisk to combine.

Add the shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Add the butter and pulse to pea-size pieces. Add the whiskey and pulse until just incorporated. Pulse in the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough holds together when pinched. Turn out the dough onto a large piece of plastic wrap and gather together, using the plastic wrap to help you. Divide into 2 pieces and gently pat each into a disk; wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.\nFor the hot toddy apple filling and caramel: Add the granulated sugar and 4 cups water to a large pot.

    "recipe": "Apple-Rosemary Souffle\nAbout 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened, for the ramekins\n2 tablespoons sugar for the ramekins\n2 4-inch sprigs fresh rosemary\n3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 pounds tart apples (about 6 large), such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, or Braeburn, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice\n1 2-inch piece cinnamon stick\n1/2 vanilla bean, split and scraped, or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger\n3 large egg yolks\nOptional: 2 tablespoons Calvados or Cognac\n6 large egg whites\n1 cup Herb-Infused Custard Sauce made with fresh bay laurel leaves or rosemary, and vanilla (recipe follows)\n2 cups herb-infused whole milk (recipe follows)\n1/2 cup sugar\n6 large egg yolks\n2 cups whole milk, plus an additional 2 tablespoons if needed\nYour choice of herb (see in main souffle recipe above)\nInstructions:\n1. Prepare the molds. Generously coat the interiors of 8 6-ounce straight-sided ramekins with the softened butter using a pastry brush or your fingers. Pour 2 tablespoons sugar into 1 dish and turn it until all surfaces are coated, then tip the sugar out into the next and repeat the process until all the ramekins have a thorough coating of butter and sugar. Set the prepared molds in a large shallow baking pan or on a half-sheet pan.  \n2. Applesauce. Tie the rosemary sprigs together with kitchen twine, wrapping the twine in a spiral up the length of the stems to keep the needles from falling off in the sauce. Put 3/4 cup sugar in a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan and place it over medium-high heat. When the sugar begins to melt, stir it with a wooden spoon. it will form big lumps at first, but keep cooking and stirring until all the sugar is dissolved and you have a smooth amber syrup. As soon as it reaches this stage, add 2 tablespoons butter and stir until it is melted and incorporated. Add the apples and stir. The caramel will harden and form lumps again, but once the sauce cooks it will dissolve. Add the rosemary bundle, cinnamon stick, and vanilla bean. Stir in the vanilla extract if using. Puree the mixture with a handheld immersion blender, in a food processor, or by passing it through a food mill. You should have a deep brown sauce that is thick enough to hold its shape in a mound. (This applesauce can be stored covered in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.)  \n3. Egg whites. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a large mixing bowl, whisk the egg yolks and liquor if suing into the applesauce. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until they form soft peaks, add the remaining 2 tablespoons sugar, and continue to beat until they form stiff peaks. Using a large rubber spatula, fold one-third of the whites into the apple mixture until it is thoroughly incorporated, then gently fold in the remaining egg whites. Tilt the bowl over the prepared souffle cups and, using the rubber spatula to carefully guide the mixture, fill the dishes to 1/2 inch of the top. Wipe up any spills ont he sides of the dishes and, using your thumb, wipe off any mixture that is touching the rims. If the souffle bakes onto any buttered surface at the top of dish, it will stick and prevent it from rising straight up. At this point the souffles can be held up to 1 hour at room temperature.  \n4. Baking. Put the baking pan holding the souffles in the oven and pour about 1/2 inch hot tap water into the pan. Bake until the souffles are nicely browned and risen about 1 1/2 inches, 20 to 25 minutes. Using tongs or oven mitts, immediately transfer the hot dishes to individual serving plates and rush them to the tables with pitchers of the custard sauce. Each guest should break open their souffle in the middle and pour in some of the custard.\n1. Heating the milk and warming the yolks. Pour the milk and sugar into a small (1 to 2-quart) saucepan and set it over medium heat. Put the egg yolks in a medium stainless-steel mixing bowl and float that bowl in a larger bowl half full of hot tap water. Whisk the yolks until they are lukewarm, about 90 degrees to 100 degrees F. (it will take less than 1 minute), then lift the bowl out of the water.  \n2. Cooking the custard. The instant the milk mixture comes to a rolling boil and rises in the pan, lift it off the heat. With the whisk in one hand and the saucepan in the other, pour the boiling milk into the egg yolks as you whisk constantly but gently. Continue to gently stir the sauce with the whisk for 30 seconds. At this point it should be fully cooked. An instant-read thermometer set in the sauce should register 170 degrees to 180 degrees F. It should coat a teaspoon, but it will become much thicker when it cools. (If for some reason the sauce did not get hot enough to thicken, you can place the bowl on top of a saucepan of boiling water and stir it with a rubber spatula until it reaches 170 degrees F. Do not heat the sauce above 180 degrees F. or it will curdle.) Now whisk the sauce rapidly for 30 seconds to cool it and then pour it through a fine sieve. Store it in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.  \nPour the milk into a small (1 to 2-quart) saucpean and place it over medium-high heat. Watch the pan carefully. As soon as the milk comes to a full boil, add the herbs and any additional flavoring, push them under the surface of the pan and let the herbs steep for 30 minutes. If they steep longer, it will have little effect on the flavor, but you should uncover the pan so that the milk can cool faster. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve into a large liquid measuring cup, pressing down firmly on the herbs with the back of a spoon to extract all the liquid from the leaves. Add fresh milk if needed to measure 2 cups.\n",

Line a 12-cup muffin pan with white paper liners. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Stir together the milk, lemon juice and vanilla in a small bowl; set aside (the milk will curdle). Beat the butter, 3/4 cup sugar and the lemon zest in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the milk mixture in two batches, until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat briefly until smooth.\nBeat the egg whites in a large bowl with a mixer on high speed until foamy. Gradually beat in the remaining 1/4 cup sugar; continue beating until stiff glossy peaks form, about 3 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold the beaten egg whites into the batter in two batches. Divide the batter evenly among 6 small bowls; tint each with 1 to 3 drops gel food coloring, stirring to distribute the color.\nDivide the purple batter evenly among the prepared muffin cups (about 1 1/2 teaspoons per cup) and gently spread to cover the bottom; layer the blue, green, yellow, orange and red batters on top, gently spreading each color but making sure not to swirl the colors together. (The liners will be full.) Bake until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently pressed, about 20 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer to a rack to cool completely.\nMeanwhile, make the frosting: Whisk the sugar, egg whites, water, vanilla, cream of tartar and salt in a large metal bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water until combined (do not let the bowl touch the water). With the bowl still over the simmering water, beat the mixture with a hand mixer on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the bowl from the saucepan and let cool 5 minutes. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Generously pipe onto the cupcakes.\n",

    "recipe": "True Brew\nBrewing a simply perfect cup of Joe can be perfectly simple, if you stick to some basic guidelines:\nInstructions:\nBuy quality whole beans from a reliable purveyor (preferably a roaster). If you don't have a grinder at home, ask a salesperson to grind whole beans for you rather than settling for pre-ground.\nPurchasing bulk (unpackaged) beans from a specialty shop is okay as long as the bins or jars are relatively small and refilled regularly. Large vats hold a lot of beans and therefore don't need frequent filling. That means that beans can hang around for a long time being exposed to light and air. That can mean stale beans, and staleness is not a desirable attribute.\nPurchase pre-packaged whole beans only when sealed in a foil-style bag featuring a one-way valve. The dime-shaped plastic valve is usually integrated into the packaging so that it will be as unobtrusive as possible, so check carefully. The absence of a valve means that the coffee probably sat and \\gassed out\\ before it was packaged. That means it could be stale. Stale, again, is not a good thing. And remember: paper bags with twist tops are temporary transportation vessels, not storage devices.\nTry to purchase only a week's worth of beans at a time. If you live where this is impractical, purchase several small sealed packages rather than one large one. Unopened one-way valve bags will keep coffee fresh for approximately three months. If you buy bulk coffee (not sealed with one-way valves) in large amounts, divide into weekly batches, seal in Mason-style jars and freeze. Transfer these small batches to counter top storage as needed (see below) .\nStore opened or bulk coffee in an airtight, opaque container and store at room temperature for up to a week.\nGrind coffee as close to brewing time as possible. For drip method, grind in blade style grinder for 15 to 20 seconds. For French presses, grind for only 10 to 12 seconds.\nRegardless of method, brew using 2 heaping tablespoons of coffee for each 6 ounces of clean (filtered or bottled), cool water. If you prefer a milder cup, brew to full strength (between 190 and 205 degrees F), and then dilute with hot water. Brewing with too little coffee will result in over-extraction, and that means bitterness.\nIf you really want to taste the subtle nuances of regional coffees, consider a gold mesh filter.\nWhen purchasing a coffee maker (either manual or electric), look for a model that brews into a thermal carafe rather than a glass pot designed to sit on a heating element. Continuous heating of coffee leads to bitterness.\nQuality decaffeinated coffees usually cost more than regular beans.\n",

    "recipe": "Roasted Lamb Chops with Harissa\nTwo 8-rib racks of lamb, Frenched\nKosher salt  \nExtra-virgin olive oil  \n2 red bell peppers\n2 teaspoons cumin seed, toasted and ground  \n2 teaspoons coriander seed, toasted and ground  \n2 teaspoons fennel seed, toasted and ground  \n2 teaspoons caraway seed, toasted and ground  \n4 dried red chiles, coarsely chopped  \n3 cloves garlic, smashed and finely chopped  \n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar  \n1/4 cup tomato paste  \nKosher salt  \n1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil  \nInstructions:\nFor the lamb: Remove 2 ribs from each rack to make it a 6-rib rack: Do this by starting from either end and removing the second and seventh bone. This creates 6 chops that are thicker than a normal lamb chop -- YUM!! Cut each rack into 6 equal chops, place on a baking sheet, and transfer to the fridge.\nFor the harissa: Preheat a grill.\nPlace the bell peppers on the grill and cook them on all sides until the skin is black and charred. Transfer the peppers to a large bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let them hang out until cool. HINT, HINT: This can totally be done ahead! YAY!\nScrape the black charred skin off the peppers and remove the stem and seeds. Coarsely chop the peppers and transfer them to the bowl of a food processor.\nAdd the cumin, coriander, fennel, caraway, chiles, garlic, vinegar, and tomato paste to the food processor and season with salt. Puree until smooth.\nAdd 1/4 cup of the olive oil to the mixture and pulse, pulse, pulse. Add the remaining 1/4 cup olive oil and pulse again until thoroughly combined. Taste and season with salt. Taste again and re-season if needed. Store in an airtight container until ready to use.\nTo make the lamb: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Remove the lamb from the fridge, season generously with salt, and let sit for 15 to 20 minutes before cooking.\nCoat a large saute pan with olive oil and bring the pan to medium-high heat. Working in batches to avoid crowding the pan, add the lamb chops and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare (if you like your meat a little more well done, lower the heat and cook them a minute or 2 longer). If the pan begins to smoke, lower the heat. The chops will be beautifully browned on each side. Stand up the chops to brown the fat edge along each chop. YUM!!! Brown food tastes good! Place the cooked chops on a baking sheet and transfer to the oven to keep them hot while the others cook.\nTop each lamb chop with a spoonful of harissa and serve.\n",

    "recipe": "Sugar Witch's Hat\n2 1/2 cups granulated sugar\nScant 2/3 cup light corn syrup\nScant 1/2 cup water\nOrange and black food color paste\nOrange and black food color paste  \nVegetable baking spray  \nInstructions:\nPlace the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat. Insert a candy thermometer and cook the sugar mixture until it reaches 320 degrees F. Remove from the heat and carefully divide the cooked sugar between 2 medium-size microwaveable glass bowls. If you leave the sugar in the pan, the sugar will continue to cook and turn dark brown. A glass bowl will hold the temperature of the sugar. I put a towel under the bowl to keep the bowl from tipping over and to protect my hands from the heat of the glass. (The sugar will stay liquid enough to work with easily for about 10 minutes; after that it will start to thicken. If this happens before you are finished, just pop the bowl in the microwave for 3 to 5 minutes, until the sugar is liquid enough to work with once again.) Add a few drops of orange food coloring to 1 bowl and mix with a wooden skewer. Add a few drops of black food coloring to the other bowl and mix with a wooden skewer.  \nTo make the brim: Trace a large circle onto a piece of parchment paper. Turn over the paper and give it a light coating of vegetable cooking spray. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the inside of the circle, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the circle, making sure to come all the way to the edges of the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You will be able to see the paper through the sugar but you want to make this layer thick. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.  \nTo make the cone of the hat: Wash, dry, and lightly but thoroughly spray the clean, dry mold with the baking spray, wiping out excess with a paper towel. Dip the tines of a fork into the hot orange sugar. Carefully but quickly wave the fork over the outside of the mold, allowing the sugar to drip off the fork in long, thin strands. Try to distribute the strands evenly around the side of the mold, making sure to come all the way to the top and the brim. Then dip the tines of the fork into the hot black sugar. Repeat the process. You should still be able to see the mold through the sugar. Make a nice thick layer of sugar so the hat will be sturdy. Set aside to cool, about 5 minutes.  \nTo unmold, place your hands on the inside of the mold and let your fingers gently pull or slide the sugar loose from the side of the mold. You will need to apply this gentle pressure all around the inside. Keep moving the sugar as it cools. This will keep it from resticking but you need to wait until the sugar has cooled. Once the sugar has released from the mold, carefully lift it out and place it over the brim. If the sugar is still too warm, the hat may begin to collapse. That is why it is a good idea to release the sugar from the mold but leave it in the mold until it has cooled completely. (At this stage, the cage can be stored, right side up, in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for 1 to 2 days.)  \nCarefully remove the parchment paper from the brim. You should be able to pull it out from under the brim. Do not worry if the brim cracks or breaks. You can use a blow torch to melt the sugar back into place. Carefully lift the cone of the hat and center it on top of the brim.\nI used a special Croquembouche mold to make my Witch's Hat because it is exactly the right shape. You do not need to buy this expensive mold to make your decoration. Use any metal or ceramic shape, preferably one that does not have outside handles or seams.  \nRemember you are working with hot sugar so be sure to have a bowl of cold water ready in case you get any of it on your skin. It is best to work with sugar on a dry day, as the humidity will melt the sugar. To be on the safe side, make your sugar decoration no more than one to two hours before you are ready to serve them.\n",

Stir to fully combine. Sprinkle about a quarter of the sugar-spice mixture in the cavity of the turkey and rub the rest all over the exterior. Place the turkey on a rack in a roasting pan and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours.\nRemove the turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting.\nArrange an oven rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F.\nIn a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.

    "recipe": "Caramel Apple Pie\nPie Dough, recipe below\n7 large Granny Smith or Pippin apples, peeled and cored\n1 cup sugar\n3 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nJuice of 1/2 lemon\n1 tablespoon heavy cream\n1 large egg\nCaramel topping, recipe follows\n1/2 cup packed brown sugar\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons heavy cream\n1/2 cup pecan halves\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup lard\n2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nAbout 1/2 cup iced water\nInstructions:\nButter and flour a 9-inch glass pie plate. On a lightly floured surface roll the dough to a 12-inch round about 1/8-inch thick. Line the pie plate, being sure to press the dough into the bottom and up the sides without stretching. Chill 30 minutes. Roughly chop the apples into small pieces, about the size of lima beans. (The apples should measure about 9 cups chopped.) Combine with the sugar, tapioca, cinnamon, salt and lemon juice in a large bowl. Set aside until the juices begin to run, about 10 - 15 minutes. Beat together the cream and egg to make a glaze and brush over the edges and bottom of the crust. Mound the apple filling in the pie shell. It will be quite full. Roll out the remaining dough to a large round about 1/8'' thick. Place over the filling a seal the edges together by gently pressing together. Trim any excess dough with scissors and flute the edges. Brush the top with the remaining egg glaze. Using a paring knife, cut out and remove a circle the size of a quarter from the center of the top crust. Cut 5 or 6 slits in a spoke pattern beginning 1/2-inch from the center hole and ending 1/2-inch from the outside edge. Chill for 30 minutes before baking.\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees. Place the pie plate on a cookie sheet and bake 10 - 15 minutes, or until the top is golden brown. Reduce the heat to 300 degrees and continue baking until the juice visible in the center becomes thick and bubbly, about 1 hour (if the edges are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil). Meanwhile prepare the caramel topping. Spoon the hot caramel over the top of the pie to coat and return to the oven. Bake 5 minutes longer, or until the caramel sets. Cool on a rack before serving.\nIn a small saucepan combine brown sugar, butter and cream. Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the pecan halves.\nIn a large bowl combine the flour with the lard, butter and salt. Mix lightly with your fingertips until the dough forms grape-sized pieces. You should be able to see chunks of fat. Stir in the iced water. Lightly knead, handling the dough as little as possible, until the dough forms a ball. Add a little more iced water if necessary. Transfer to a plastic bag and shape into a log. Seal the bag, pressing out any air, and chill for as little as 1 hour or as long as 3 days. The pie dough can be frozen for as long as a week.\n",

    "recipe": "Paris-Brest Custard Cake\n1 cup water\n8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons sugar\n1 cup flour\n3 to 5 eggs\n1 1/2 teaspoons water\n1/2 cup sliced almonds\nCustard, recipe follows\nWhipped cream, recipe follows\nConfectioners' sugar\n2 cups whole, 2 percent fat, or 1 percent fat milk\n1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise\n6 egg yolks\n2/3 cup sugar\n1/4 cup cornstarch\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n2 cups chilled heavy cream\n2 tablespoons light brown sugar, packed\nInstructions:\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a large piece of parchment paper, trace a circle 10 inches in diameter. Use this parchment paper to line a baking sheet, pencil side down (you should still be able to see the circle). In a large saucepan, bring the water, butter, salt, and granulated sugar to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. When it boils, immediately take the pan off the heat. Stirring with a wooden spoon, add all the flour at once and stir hard until all the flour is incorporated, 30 to 60 seconds. Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring, 30 seconds to evaporate some of the moisture.\nScrape the mixture into a mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer). Mix at medium speed. With the mixer running and, working 1 egg at a time, add 3 of the eggs, stopping after each addition to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Mix until the dough is smooth and glossy and the eggs are completely incorporated. The dough should be thick, but should fall slowly and steadily from the beaters when you lift them out of the bowl. If the dough is still clinging to the beaters, add 1 more egg and mix until incorporated.\nUsing a pastry bag fitted with a large plain tip and using the pencil line as a guide, pipe the dough onto baking sheet in a ring. Pipe a second ring around the first one, hugging it so the 2 rings touch closely all the way around. Pipe a third circle, using up all the remaining dough, on the crack between the first 2 rings so that all 3 rings touch closely, forming 1 big ring with 3 parts.\nWhisk the remaining egg with the water. Brush the surface of the dough with the egg wash (do not use all of it). Sprinkle the almonds over the surface. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 375 degrees and bake until puffed up and light golden brown, about 25 minutes more. Try not to open the oven door too often during the baking. Let cool on the baking sheet. The recipe can be made up to this point up to 24 hours in advance. Hold at room temperature, lightly covered with aluminum foil.\nCustard: In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and vanilla bean to a boil over medium heat. Immediately turn off the heat and set aside to infuse for 10 to 15 minutes. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. Add the cornstarch and whisk vigorously until no lumps remain. Whisk in 1/4 cup of the hot milk mixture until incorporated. Whisk in the remaining hot milk mixture, reserving the empty saucepan.\nPour the mixture through a strainer back into the saucepan. Cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and slowly boiling. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter. Let cool slightly. Cover with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Chill at least 2 hours or until ready to serve. The custard can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Refrigerate until 1 hour before using.\nWhipped Cream: When ready to serve, whip the cream and brown sugar until stiff.\nUsing a long serrated knife, cut the pastry ring in half horizontally. Set the top half aside. Using a clean pastry bag, pipe the custard filling onto the bottom half. Pipe the whipped cream on top of the custard. Place the top half of the pastry lightly on the whipped cream, dust with confectioners' sugar, and serve, cut into sections.\n",

    "recipe": "My Grandma's Ravioli\n1 pound baking potatoes (about 2 large), scrubbed thoroughly\n2 tablespoons (1/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus 8 tablespoons (1 stick)\n2 tablespoons minced shallots\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\n8 ounces farmer's cheese\n5 ounces goat cheese\n2 ounces mascarpone\n3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan, plus 1/4 cup freshly grated\n2 tablespoons minced fresh mint leaves\n2 tablespoons minced fresh chervil leaves\n1 egg, lightly beaten\nKosher salt and freshly ground white pepper\nBasic Pasta Dough, recipe follows\nSemolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting\n1 egg lightly beaten with 1 teaspoon water, for egg wash\n1 tablespoon olive oil\nMinced fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves\n1/4 cup toasted and chopped hazelnuts\n3 cups flour\n8 large egg yolks\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n3 to 5 tablespoons water\nSemolina or all-purpose flour, for dusting\nInstructions:\nMake the filling: Bake the potatoes in a preheated 350 degree F. oven until fork tender, about 30 to 40 minutes. Peel, and while still warm, pass through a food mill. In a small saute pan, heat the 2 tablespoons butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic, and cook until soft. In a medium bowl, combine the farmer's cheese, goat cheese, mascarpone, 3 tablespoons Parmesan, the herbs, and the beaten egg. Add the cooked shallots and garlic and the warm potato. Stir until blended (being careful not to overmix, or the mixture will get pasty). Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until needed. Then, with lightly moistened hands, roll into 1/2-ounce balls, about the size of golf balls.\nCut the pasta dough into 4 portions and work with 1 portion at a time, keeping the remaining dough covered with plastic wrap. Lightly dust the work surface with flour. With a pasta machine or a rolling pin, roll out the dough about 20 inches long and 4 inches wide. Brush the dough with egg wash and arrange 9 to 10 balls of filling on the lower third of the length of the dough, about 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart.\nFold the top half over to cover the balls. Press the dough around each ball to seal, making sure that you do not have any air pockets. With a 2-inch round cookie cutter, cut the ravioli. Dust a tray with flour and arrange the ravioli on the tray, dusting with more flour. Repeat with the remaining dough, egg wash, and filling. Refrigerate, covered, until needed.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the ravioli until al dente, about 3 to 4 minutes.\nMeanwhile, in a large saute pan, over high heat, add the oil and the remaining butter. Cook the butter until it begins to brown. Drain the ravioli and toss into the browned butter, turning to coat both sides. Add the remaining Parmesan and season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and hazelnuts and serve immediately.\nIn a food processor fitted with the steel blade, combine the flour, egg yolks, salt, olive oil, and 2 tablespoons of the water. Process until the dough begins to hold together, then stop the machine and pinch the dough to test it. If it's too dry, add up to 1 more tablespoon of water and process until it forms a moist ball. Turn out on a lightly floured smooth work surface and knead by hand, until a smooth ball is formed. Loosely wrap in plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour.\nCut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Keep the other pieces covered in plastic while you roll out 1 piece at a time, by hand with a rolling pin or through the rollers of a pasta machine, stretching the dough to the desired thickness.\nIf using a pasta machine, set the rollers at the widest opening. Flatten the first piece of dough into a thick strip no wider than the machine, to enable it to pass through the rollers. If necessary, dust the pasta very lightly with flour. Run the pasta through the machine. Fold in thirds, crosswise, and run through the machine again. Repeat this procedure 2 or more times, until the dough is smooth and somewhat elastic. Set the machine to the next smaller opening and run the dough through the rollers.\nContinue rolling and stretching the dough, using the smaller opening each time, until the next to the last or the last opening is reached, dusting lightly with flour only as necessary. (The strip of dough will be long. If you don't have enough space on your worktable, halfway through the rolling process cut the strip of dough in half and continue to work with each piece separately, keeping the unused dough covered).\nAdjust the cutting mechanism to the desired width, cut the noodles, and allow them to dry before cooking. A convenient way to dry pasta is to arrange the cut pasta on a pastry tray sprinkled with flour, preferably semolina flour. As 1 layer is completed, sprinkle flour over the noodles, place a piece of parchment paper over them, and continue layering with noodles and flour. Dry for at least 15 to 20 minutes.\nRepeat with the remaining pieces of dough.\n",

(Reserve the potato innards for another use, like potato soup or mashed potatoes, or feed them to your chickies.)\nSalt the insides of the potatoes, then crack an egg into the center of each potato. Add 1/2 tablespoon cream, a good pinch of salt, a turn of pepper, hot sauce, if using, and a quarter of the onion and pepper to the center of each potato.

    "recipe": "Butternut Squash Meringue Box Harvest Dessert\n1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar\n3 egg whites\n3/4 cup granulated sugar\nNonstick cooking spray\n1 cup whole milk\n1/2 cup butternut squash puree\n1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for garnish\nPinch ground cloves\nPinch ground nutmeg\n3 egg yolks\n2 tablespoons cold butter, cubed\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 cups heavy whipping cream\nWhite royal icing, for assembly\nConfectioners' sugar, for garnish\nInstructions:\nFor the meringue: Preheat the oven to 150 degrees F. In a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites until frothy. Add the cream of tarter and continue to whisk until soft peaks form. Once the whites are at soft peaks, slowly add in the granulated sugar and continue whisking until stiff peaks form and the egg whites are smooth and glossy.\nPlace a nonstick baking pad on an upside-down baking sheet and then spray with nonstick cooking spray. Scoop the meringue into a square shape using a 3-inch square stencil. Smooth out the edges and make the squares even with a long, flat icing spatula. Make as many squares that can fit onto the baking sheet. You'll need 6 sides to make a full box, so make sides based on how many boxes you want to make. Remove the stencil. Bake the meringue until set and not tacky to the touch, 3 hours. The meringue should have no color on it after baking.\nFor the diplomat cream: In a saucepan, bring the milk to a light simmer. In a bowl, lightly whisk the squash puree, 1/4 cup of the granulated sugar, the cornstarch, flour, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and yolks until smooth. Add half of the steaming milk into squash mixture very slowly, whisking as you pour. Whisk in the remaining milk. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and add the cubed butter and vanilla, mixing until the butter melts. Cover the mixture with plastic wrap, lightly pressing the plastic against the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cool the pastry cream completely.\nOnce the pastry cream is completely cool, place the heavy cream and the remaining 1 tablespoon granulated sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the whisk, and whip until stiff. Fold the whipped cream into the cooled pastry cream to create the diplomat cream. Keep refrigerated.\nUse royal icing as the glue between the sides of the box, leaving one side open. When the box is set, spoon the diplomat cream into the box and top with the final side as the lid. Dust with cinnamon and confectioners' sugar to garnish, and then serve.\n",

    "recipe": "Rasmalai\n6 1/3 cups (1 1/2 liters) whole milk\n1/2 teaspoon saffron strands (or more if you want to be decadent)  \n1/2 cup sugar  \n1/2 teaspoon decorticated cardamom (or seeds from about 8 cardamom pods), coarsely crushed  \n4 tablespoons blanched almonds or shelled pistachios, sliced or chopped\n6 1/3 cups (1 1/2 liters) whole milk\n3 to 5 tablespoons lemon or lime juice\n1 1/2 cups sugar\nInstructions:\nFor the sauce (ras): Heat the milk over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, stirring every minute or so in the beginning and more often as it comes closer to a boil to ensure that the milk doesn't burn at the bottom, until it comes to a boil, about 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to keep it at a medium boil and cook, stirring frequently, until the milk is reduced by half, 25 to 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile, combine the saffron strands with 1 tablespoon of the hot milk in a small bowl. Mash with the back of the spoon to get the saffron to release its color and turn the milk a deep orange.    \nOnce the milk has reduced, add the sugar, crushed cardamom and saffron-milk mixture and mix well. Cook, stirring as needed so the milk does not stick to the bottom of the pan, until the milk is well flavored, about 5 minutes. Add 3 tablespoons of the nuts, saving the balance for garnish, and let the milk mixture cool.    \nFor the paneer balls (rasgullas): Heat the milk over medium-high heat in a large, heavy-bottomed pot, stirring every minute or so in the beginning and more often as it comes closer to a boil to ensure that the milk doesn't burn at the bottom, until it comes to a boil, about 10 minutes.    \nAs soon as it reaches a boil, turn off the heat and add 1/2 cup of ice to reduce the temperature of the milk. Add the lemon or lime juice 1 tablespoon at a time until the milk is curdled and the solids separate from the whey. The whey will turn greenish-yellow. Add another 1/2 cup of ice. This stops the cooking and keeps the paneer soft.  \nLine a strainer with folded-over cheesecloth or muslin and set over a large bowl. Pour the mixture into the strainer and let the water drain out. Pour a cup of cold water over the paneer and drain. Take the ends of the cloth and squeeze out the excess water very well. Hang the cloth to further drain out water from the paneer for about 30 minutes. The paneer should be crumbly yet a little moist.    \nAdd the paneer to a food processer and process until the crumbles become a ball, about 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can knead it with the heel of your palm, but this will take 10 to 15 minutes.    \nRoll the dough into 12 equal balls, making sure there are no cracks. (A kitchen scale isn\\u2019t necessary but is helpful.) You can keep them round or gently flatten them out to disks about 1 inch high. If you see any cracks, smooth them over with wet fingers. Cover with a damp cloth.    \nFor the sugar syrup: Combine the sugar and 7 cups water in a wide Dutch oven and bring to a rolling boil. Add the prepared paneer balls one by one so the temperature doesn\\u2019t drop suddenly. Gently shake the pot, lower the heat slightly to keep the mixture at a low boil, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Do not open the lid in between. Gently stir the balls, cover and cook for another 5 minutes. The balls should almost double in size. Remove the pot from the heat and let it cool naturally, 20 to 30 minutes. The balls will sink in the water.    \nOnce cooled, drain the balls. Very gently squeeze out the syrup from the balls and transfer them to the prepared ras (saffron milk). Refrigerate for a minimum of 3 hours, to let the balls absorb the milk and become divine! Garnish with the reserved nuts and serve cold.    \n",

Add the coconut oil in small spoonfuls, and pulse until the largest pieces are pea-sized. Add 4 tablespoons ice water, and pulse until evenly combined. Squeeze a handful of the dough together; it should just hold its shape. If the mixture is too powdery, pulse in an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons ice water. Turn the dough out onto a large piece of plastic wrap, pat into a 1/2-inch-thick disc and chill for at least 1 hour up to overnight.\nTo make rolling easier, let the dough soften up a bit-it should be slightly soft when pressed-at room temperature (this may take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the temperature of your kitchen). Roll the disc into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface or between two pieces of floured parchment paper. If the dough gets too warm, refrigerate it to firm it up. Ease the crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself, and crimp the edge as desired.

    "recipe": "Smoked Salmon Pizza (a la Wolfgang)\n1 cup kosher salt\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns\n1 whole side salmon, pin bones removed\n2 cups warm water (105 degrees F to 115 degrees F)\n2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (one 1/4-ounce envelope)\n5 to 5 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting, preferably organic\n2 teaspoons fine sea salt\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for brushing\nCanola oil, for brushing\n3/4 cup creme fraiche\n2 tablespoons finely chopped mixed fresh herbs (dill, chervil, chives, parsley), plus more whole herbs for garnish\n2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper  \n1/4 cup capers in brine, rinsed\n1 red onion, thinly sliced\nInstructions:\nFor the smoked salmon: Mix the kosher salt, brown sugar, granulated sugar and peppercorns in a medium bowl. Cut a piece of extra-wide aluminum foil a little longer than the length of the salmon. Place an equally long piece of plastic wrap on top of the foil. Sprinkle one-third of the salt rub onto the plastic. Lay one side of the salmon skin-side down onto the rub. Sprinkle another third of the rub onto the flesh of the salmon. Place the second side of the salmon flesh-side down onto the first side. Use the remaining rub to cover the skin on the top piece. Fold the plastic over the salmon to cover, and then close the edges of the foil together and crimp tightly around the salmon. The salmon should be folded in half and wrapped.  \nPlace the wrapped salmon on a baking sheet and top with another baking sheet. Weigh the top pan down with a brick or two. Refrigerate the salmon for 12 hours. Flip the salmon over and refrigerate for another 12 hours. Some juice will leak out during the refrigeration process, so make sure there's a place for the runoff to gather.\nUnwrap the salmon and rinse off the salt rub with cold water. Pat the salmon dry with paper towels and place in a cool, dry place (not the refrigerator) until the surface of the salmon is dry and matte-like, 1 to 3 hours depending on humidity. A fan may be used to speed the process.  \nPreheat the smoker. Smoke the salmon over the smoldering alder wood chips until the thickest part of the salmon registers 150 degrees, about 30 minutes. Keep the temperature inside the smoker between 190 and 200 degrees F. Serve the salmon immediately, or cool to room temperature, wrap tightly and refrigerate for up to 3 days.  \nMeanwhile, for the pizza dough: Place the warm water and yeast in a large bowl. When the yeast dissolves, let the water stand about 5 minutes. Stir in 3 cups of the flour and the fine salt until smooth. Stir in an additional 2 cups of the flour and continue adding flour (up to 1/2 cup) 1 tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes away from the bowl but is still sticky.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead with lightly floured hands. Slap the dough onto the counter, pulling it toward you with one hand and pushing it away from you with the other. Fold the dough back over itself using a bench scraper or a wide knife to help scrape dough from surface. Repeat the process until the dough is easier to handle, about 10 times. Finish kneading until the dough is smooth, elastic and soft, but a little tacky, about 10 minutes.  \nLightly oil a bowl with olive oil. Shape the dough into 2 balls and transfer to the bowl. Turn to coat the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. The dough is done when you press it with your finger and an indent remains.  \nGently remove the dough from the bowl. Roll each dough half into a ball and place on a lightly-floured baking sheet. Brush the dough balls lightly with olive oil. Cover the baking sheet lightly with plastic wrap and set aside for 15 minutes.  \nPrepare charcoal in a chimney starter (allowing the charcoal to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a thin layer of gray ash).

Add eggs and whisk until well combined; add flour and mix only until combined. Do not overmix or the cake will be rubbery. Lightly grease four 4-ounce disposable aluminum cups, muffin molds, or ramekins with vegetable baking spray. Distribute batter among the four molds. Place molds on a sheet pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. Do not overbake.\nFor the Chocolate Sauce: Pour the milk into a 2-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, place over medium-high heat, and bring to a boil. When it boils, remove the milk from the heat and make a ganache by adding the chopped chocolate. Whisk well, stirring into the edge of the saucepan to combine. The ganache should be homogenous and smooth. Set the ganache aside.\nIn a 1-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, and sugar. Place the saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. The butter should be completely melted and the sugar completely dissolved. Once the mixture has come to a boil, pour it into the warm ganache. Place the sauce over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly with a whisk. As the chocolate sauce cooks, it will begin to thicken slightly. When it reaches a boil, remove it from the heat, and pour it into a clean, dry bowl. Cover by placing plastic wrap directly on top of the sauce to prevent a skin from forming. Let the chocolate sauce cool to room temperature before storing in the refrigerator. When cold, the sauce will become thick enough to be scooped with a spoon.\nInvert molds onto individual serving plates. If you would like to decorate the plate, do so with fresh raspberries or fruit or chocolate sauce, and serve immediately.\nThe sauce can be reheated whenever needed. If using a microwave, simply place the chocolate sauce in a microwaveable bowl and heat it at medium-high power in 30-second intervals until it becomes liquid. On the stovetop, place in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat and stir occasionally until it becomes liquid. If you store it in a squeeze bottle, you can easily drizzle it over a dessert or decorate a plate. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to three weeks. It can also be frozen for up to two months if stored in an airtight container. Thaw in the refrigerator and heat as described above until liquid.\n",

Process until a fine powder is formed, approximately 30 seconds.\nPat the ribs dry and turn bone-side up. Trim excess fat and, if one end of the ribs is especially narrow, trim meat and bone to ensure even cooking. Remove the membrane on the underside of the ribs by inserting a rounded utensil, an upside-down spoon works well, between the membrane and the meat at one end of the slab. Carefully work the spoon under the membrane to loosen but not tear. Once enough has been loosened, use a paper towel to hold onto the membrane as you slowly pull it down the slab to remove.\nSprinkle the ribs on both sides with the salt and brush both sides with the mustard. Sprinkle two-thirds of the spice mixture on the meat side of the ribs and the remaining third on the bone side.\nOnce the smoker has reached 225 degrees F, add the wood chips or chunks and the ribs to the smoker.\nSmoke for 4 to 5 hours then test for doneness. There are four criteria that should be met in order for ribs to be done. First, the internal temperature of the meat should be 185 to 190 degrees F. Second, pick up each slab from the center with tongs and it should droop into a u-shape and crack slightly. Third, while holding with the tongs, and bouncing gently, the surface of the ribs should crack slightly. Lastly, the meat should pull easily off the bone but not fall off. If ribs pass all tests, remove them from the smoker and wrap in heavy-duty foil and rest for 15 minutes. If not, continue smoking for 45 minutes to 1 hour and test again until done.\n",

    "recipe": "Tacos de Puerco Enchipotlado con Salsa de Jitomate Pasado (Spicy Chipotle Pork Tacos with Sun-Dried Tomato Salsa)\n2 (about 1 pound total) pork tenderloins\n1 (7-ounce) can chipotle chiles en adobo\n1 cup fresh orange juice\n1 cup (about 2 ounces) sun-dried tomatoes, halved\n1 small red onion, finely chopped (a generous 1/2 cup)\n1/2 cup chopped, pitted kalamata olives\n1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro\nAbout 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice\nSalt\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil, rich-tasting pork lard or bacon drippings\n12 fresh, warm corn tortillas (reheat store-bought ones or make them from scratch)\nInstructions:\nButterflying and marinating the pork: Lay 1 tenderloin on your cutting board and cut it in half. Now, with a sharp knife, make a horizontal cut through 1 half (you'll be cutting parallel with the board) from one long side to within 1/4- inch of the other. This will allow you to fold open the meat like a book, utilizing that 1/4-inch uncut side as a hinge. Using a meat pounder or heavy mallet, pound the pork to between 1/4 to 1/8-inch thickness.\nIn a food processor or blender, thoroughly puree the chipotles and all the canning sauce. With a pastry or basting brush, liberally paint the meat on both sides with the pureed chipotles. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 24 hours). Repeat with the other tenderloin pieces. (There will be considerably more chipotle puree than you need; cover and refrigerate the leftover for up to 2 weeks and use it to marinate other meat, fish, poultry or vegetables.)\nSoaking the sun-dried tomatoes: In a small saucepan bring the orange juice just to a boil. Add the sun-dried tomatoes, stir well, cover and remove from the heat. Let stand, stirring once or twice, until softened, about 20 minutes.\nSalsa: Scrape the soaked tomatoes and the juice into a food processor or blender, and measure in 1 tablespoon of chipotle puree. Pulse the processor until the tomatoes are rather finely chopped (not pureed). Scrape into a small serving bowl. Rinse the chopped onion under cold water, shake off the excess liquid and add it to the salsa along with the olives, cilantro and the lime juice. Stir everything together, then taste and season with salt, usually about 1/4 teaspoon. Adjust the consistency to that of an easily spoonable salsa with additional juice or water if needed. Set aside at room temperature while you cook the meat.\nSearing the meat: Set a large (12-inch) heavy well-seasoned or non-stick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Add the lard, oil or bacon drippings, brushing or spreading it around to evenly coat the surface. (If using a non-stick surface, oil the meat instead of the pan.) When the oil is very hot (it'll just begin to smoke), lay on one of the marinated meat pieces in a single layer. Sear on one side until beginning to brown (2 to 3 minutes), flip it over, and sear the other side about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a baking sheet in a single layer and keep warm in the oven. Sear the remaining meat and add to the baking sheet.\nChop or slice the meat into smallish pieces and scoop into a warm serving bowl. Set on the table along with the salsa and warm tortillas, and your meal is ready.\n",

Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chorizo and cook until crispy, about 3 minutes. Add the celery, garlic, onion, sage and apricots and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl and cool slightly.\nAdd the brioche cubes to the vegetables and toss. Add the egg, salt, pepper, and enough of the chicken broth to moisten the bread, and toss.\nSeason the quail inside and out with salt and pepper.

(The recipe may be prepared up to this point 1 day ahead, covered, and refrigerated.)\nBake the stuffing until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon of the remaining olive oil in an ovenproof medium skillet over high heat.

Repeat with the remaining quail, adding more olive oil if necessary. Reserve the skillet and drippings. Transfer the quail to the oven and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the cavity reads 160 degrees, about 20 minutes.\nFor the Sauce: Add the shallots to the reserved drippings in the skillet over medium heat and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the red wine and simmer until reduced by about half, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon to scrape up the browned bits. Add the demi-glace or chicken stock, the apricots and currants.

Make a ganache by pouring about half of the hot cream over the chocolate and letting it sit for 30 seconds to melt the chocolate. Then, slowly whisk until smooth and homogenous. Do not add all of the hot cream to the cold chocolate at once. The shock of the temperature extremes will cause the fat in the chocolate to separate. As the chocolate melts, you will see some elasticity if there is no fat separation. This means the chocolate still has an emulsion; the fat molecules are still holding together. If the ganache separates, it loses its elasticity, collapses, and becomes very liquid. I use a hand-held immersion blender to ensure a smooth ganache and to keep the emulsion of the chocolate. Add the remaining cream gradually and mix until all of the hot cream is incorporated and the ganache is smooth and homogenous.\nIf the ganache separates, it is very easy to fix. Simply add a small amount of cold cream and whisk well. This will bring the ganache back together. The ganache should be thick, shiny, and smooth. Add the desired flavoring and mix until fully incorporated. Pour the ganache onto a plastic wrap-covered baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Cover the ganache with plastic wrap and allow it to cool for at least 4 hours at room temperature. I usually make the ganache at the end of the day and let it cool overnight. As it cools, it will thicken and set.\nWhen the ganache has cooled to the consistency of toothpaste, use an offset spatula to cover the cake layer with the ganache.\n",
