## Welcome to our recipe 

[Similarity Search](https://weaviate.io/blog/vector-search-explained) leverages various machine learning models to perform searches based on semantic similarity. In Weaviate, this is done with `query.nearText`, `query.nearObject` and `query.nearVector` operators.

To run this, add your `MISTRAL_API_KEY` to your .env file.
